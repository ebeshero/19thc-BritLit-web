      <div id="preface"> PREFACE. <p>The First Volume of these Poems has already been submitted to
            general perusal. It was published, as an experiment which, I hoped, might be of some use
            to ascertain, how far, by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real
            language of men in a state of vivid sensation, that sort of pleasure and that quantity
            of pleasure may be imparted, which a Poet may rationally endeavour to impart. </p>
         <p> I had formed no very inaccurate estimate of the probable effect of those Poems: I
            flattered myself that they who should be pleased with them would read them with more
            than common pleasure: and on the other hand I was well aware that by those who should
            dislike them they would be read with more than common dislike. The result has differed
            from my expectation in this only, that I have pleased a greater number, than I ventured
            to hope I should please. </p>
         <p>For the sake of variety and from a consciousness of my own weakness I was induced to
            request the assistance of a Friend, who furnished me with the Poems of the ANCIENT
            MARINER, the FOSTER-MOTHER’S TALE, the NIGHTINGALE, the DUNGEON, and the Poem entitled
            LOVE. I should not, however, have requested this assistance, had I not believed that the
            poems of my Friend would in a great measure have the same tendency as my own, and that,
            though there would be found a difference, there would be found no discordance in the
            colours of our style; as our opinions on the subject of poetry do almost entirely
            coincide. </p>
         <p>Several of my Friends are anxious for the success of these Poems from a belief, that if
            the views, with which they were composed, were indeed realized, a class of Poetry would
            be produced, well adapted to interest mankind permanently, and not unimportant in the
            multiplicity and in the quality of its moral relations: and on this account they have
            advised me to prefix a systematic defence of the theory, upon which the poems were
            written. But I was unwilling to undertake the task, because I knew that on this occasion
            the Reader would look coldly upon my arguments, since I might be suspected of having
            been principally influenced by the selfish and foolish hope of reasoning him into an
            approbation of these particular Poems: and I was still more unwilling to undertake the
            task, because adequately to display my opinions and fully to enforce my arguments would
            require a space wholly disproportionate to the nature of a preface. For to treat the
            subject with the clearness and coherence, of which I believe it susceptible, it would be
            necessary to give a full account of the present state of the public taste in this
            country, and to determine how far this taste is healthy or depraved; which again could
            not be determined, without pointing out, in what manner language and the human mind act
            and react on each other, and without retracing the revolutions not of literature alone
            but likewise of society itself. I have therefore altogether declined to enter regularly
            upon this defence; yet I am sensible, that there would be some impropriety in abruptly
            obtruding upon the Public, without a few words of introduction, Poems so materially
            different from those, upon which general approbation is at present bestowed. </p>
         <p>It is supposed, that by the act of writing in verse an Author makes a formal engagement
            that he will gratify certain known habits of association, that he not only thus apprizes
            the Reader that certain classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book, but
            that others will be carefully excluded. This exponent or symbol held forth by metrical
            language must in different aeras of literature have excited very different expectations:
            for example, in the age of Catullus Terence and Lucretius, and that of Statius or
            Claudian, and in our own country, in the age of Shakespeare and Beaumont and Fletcher,
            and that of Donne and Cowley, or Dryden, or Pope. I will not take upon me to determine
            the exact import of the promise which by the act of writing in verse an Author in the
            present day makes to his Reader; but I am certain it will appear to many persons that I
            have not fulfilled the terms of an engagement thus voluntarily contracted. I hope
            therefore the Reader will not censure me, if I attempt to state what I have proposed to
            myself to perform, and also, (as far as the limits of a preface will permit) to explain
            some of the chief reasons which have determined me in the choice of my purpose: that at
            least he may be spared any unpleasant feeling of disappointment, and that I myself may
            be protected from the most dishonorable accusation which can be brought against an
            Author, namely, that of an indolence which prevents him from endeavouring to ascertain
            what is his duty, or, when his duty is ascertained prevents him from performing it. </p>
         <p>The principal object then which I proposed to myself in these Poems was to make the
            incidents of common life interesting by tracing in them, truly though not
            ostentatiously, the primary laws of our nature: chiefly as far as regards the manner in
            which we associate ideas in a state of excitement. Low and rustic life was generally
            chosen because in that situation the essential passions of the heart find a better soil
            in which they can attain their maturity, are less under restraint, and speak a plainer
            and more emphatic language; because in that situation our elementary feelings exist in a
            state of greater simplicity and consequently may be more accurately contemplated and
            more forcibly communicated; because the manners of rural life germinate from those
            elementary feelings; and from the necessary character of rural occupations are more
            easily comprehended; and are more durable; and lastly, because in that situation the
            passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature. The
            language too of these men is adopted (purified indeed from what appear to be its real
            defects, from all lasting and rational causes of dislike or disgust) because such men
            hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is
            originally derived; and because, from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow
            circle of their intercourse, being less under the action of social vanity they convey
            their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions. Accordingly such a
            language arising out of repeated experience and regular feelings is a more permanent and
            a far more philosophical language than that which is frequently substituted for it by
            Poets, who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art in
            proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of men, and indulge in
            arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in order to furnish food for fickle tastes
            and fickle appetites of their own creation.<span class="noteRef">[1]</span></p>
         <span class="footNote">[Footnote 1: It is worth while here to observe that the affecting
            parts of Chaucer are almost always expressed in language pure and universally
            intelligible even to this day.]</span>
         <p> I cannot be insensible of the present outcry against the triviality and meanness both
            of thought and language, which some of my contemporaries have occasionally introduced
            into their metrical compositions; and I acknowledge that this defect where it exists, is
            more dishonorable to the Writer’s own character than false refinement or arbitrary
            innovation, though I should contend at the same time that it is far less pernicious in
            the sum of its consequences. From such verses the Poems in these volumes will be found
            distinguished at least by one mark of difference, that each of them has a worthy
            purpose. Not that I mean to say, that I always began to write with a distinct purpose
            formally conceived; but I believe that my habits of meditation have so formed my
            feelings, as that my descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those feelings,
            will be found to carry along with them a purpose. If in this opinion I am mistaken I can
            have little right to the name of a Poet. For all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow
            of powerful feelings; but though this be true, Poems to which any value can be attached,
            were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who being possessed of more
            than usual organic sensibility had also thought long and deeply. For our continued
            influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts, which are indeed the
            representatives of all our past feelings; and as by contemplating the relation of these
            general representatives to each other, we discover what is really important to men, so
            by the repetition and continuance of this act feelings connected with important subjects
            will be nourished, till at length, if we be originally possessed of much organic
            sensibility, such habits of mind will be produced that by obeying blindly and
            mechanically the impulses of those habits we shall describe objects and utter sentiments
            of such a nature and in such connection with each other, that the understanding of the
            being to whom we address ourselves, if he be in a healthful state of association, must
            necessarily be in some degree enlightened, his taste exalted, and his affections
            ameliorated. </p>
         <p> I have said that each of these poems has a purpose. I have also informed my Reader what
            this purpose will be found principally to be: namely to illustrate the manner in which
            our feelings and ideas are associated in a state of excitement. But speaking in less
            general language, it is to follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when agitated by
            the great and simple affections of our nature. This object I have endeavoured in these
            short essays to attain by various means; by tracing the maternal passion through many of
            its more subtle windings, as in the poems of the IDIOT BOY and the MAD MOTHER; by
            accompanying the last struggles of a human being at the approach of death, cleaving in
            solitude to life and society, as in the Poem of the FORSAKEN INDIAN; by shewing, as in
            the Stanzas entitled WE ARE SEVEN, the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood
            attend our notion of death, or rather our utter inability to admit that notion; or by
            displaying the strength of fraternal, or to speak more philosophically, of moral
            attachment when early associated with the great and beautiful objects of nature, as in
            THE BROTHERS; or, as in the Incident of SIMON LEE, by placing my Reader in the way of
            receiving from ordinary moral sensations another and more salutary impression than we
            are accustomed to receive from them. It has also been part of my general purpose to
            attempt to sketch characters under the influence of less impassioned feelings, as in the
            OLD MAN TRAVELLING, THE TWO THIEVES, &amp;c. characters of which the elements are
            simple, belonging rather to nature than to manners, such as exist now and will probably
            always exist, and which from their constitution may be distinctly and profitably
            contemplated. I will not abuse the indulgence of my Reader by dwelling longer upon this
            subject; but it is proper that I should mention one other circumstance which
            distinguishes these Poems from the popular Poetry of the day; it is this, that the
            feeling therein developed gives importance to the action and situation and not the
            action and situation to the feeling. My meaning will be rendered perfectly intelligible
            by referring my Reader to the Poems entitled POOR SUSAN and the CHILDLESS FATHER,
            particularly to the last Stanza of the latter Poem. </p>
         <p> I will not suffer a sense of false modesty to prevent me from asserting, that I point
            my Reader’s attention to this mark of distinction far less for the sake of these
            particular Poems than from the general importance of the subject. The subject is indeed
            important! For the human mind is capable of excitement without the application of gross
            and violent stimulants; and he must have a very faint perception of its beauty and
            dignity who does not know this, and who does not further know that one being is elevated
            above another in proportion as he possesses this capability. It has therefore appeared
            to me that to endeavour to produce or enlarge this capability is one of the best
            services in which, at any period, a Writer can be engaged; but this service, excellent
            at all times, is especially so at the present day. For a multitude of causes unknown to
            former times are now acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of
            the mind, and unfitting it for all voluntary exertion to reduce it to a state of almost
            savage torpor. The most effective of these causes are the great national events which
            are daily taking place, and the encreasing accumulation of men in cities, where the
            uniformity of their occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident which the
            rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies. To this tendency of life and
            manners the literature and theatrical exhibitions of the country have conformed
            themselves. The invaluable works of our elder writers, I had almost said the works of
            Shakespeare and Milton, are driven into neglect by frantic novels, sickly and stupid
            German Tragedies, and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse.—When I think
            upon this degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation I am almost ashamed to have
            spoken of the feeble effort with which I have endeavoured to counteract it; and
            reflecting upon the magnitude of the general evil, I should be oppressed with no
            dishonorable melancholy, had I not a deep impression of certain inherent and
            indestructible qualities of the human mind, and likewise of certain powers in the great
            and permanent objects that act upon it which are equally inherent and indestructible;
            and did I not further add to this impression a belief that the time is approaching when
            the evil will be systematically opposed by men of greater powers and with far more
            distinguished success. </p>
         <p>Having dwelt thus long on the subjects and aim of these Poems, I shall request the
            Reader’s permission to apprize him of a few circumstances relating to their style, in
            order, among other reasons, that I may not be censured for not having performed what I
            never attempted. Except in a very few instances the Reader will find no personifications
            of abstract ideas in these volumes, not that I mean to censure such personifications:
            they may be well fitted for certain sorts of composition, but in these Poems I propose
            to myself to imitate, and, as far as possible, to adopt the very language of men, and I
            do not find that such personifications make any regular or natural part of that
            language. I wish to keep my Reader in the company of flesh and blood, persuaded that by
            so doing I shall interest him. Not but that I believe that others who pursue a different
            track may interest him likewise: I do not interfere with their claim, I only wish to
            prefer a different claim of my own. There will also be found in these volumes little of
            what is usually called poetic diction; I have taken as much pains to avoid it as others
            ordinarily take to produce it; this I have done for the reason already alleged, to bring
            my language near to the language of men, and further, because the pleasure which I have
            proposed to myself to impart is of a kind very different from that which is supposed by
            many persons to be the proper object of poetry. I do not know how without being culpably
            particular I can give my Reader a more exact notion of the style in which I wished these
            poems to be written than by informing him that I have at all times endeavoured to look
            steadily at my subject, consequently I hope it will be found that there is in these
            Poems little falsehood of description, and that my ideas are expressed in language
            fitted to their respective importance. Something I must have gained by this practice, as
            it is friendly to one property of all good poetry, namely good sense; but it has
            necessarily cut me off from a large portion of phrases and figures of speech which from
            father to son have long been regarded as the common inheritance of Poets. I have also
            thought it expedient to restrict myself still further, having abstained from the use of
            many expressions, in themselves proper and beautiful, but which have been foolishly
            repeated by bad Poets till such feelings of disgust are connected with them as it is
            scarcely possible by any art of association to overpower. </p>
         <p>If in a Poem there should be found a series of lines, or even a single line, in which
            the language, though naturally arranged and according to the strict laws of metre, does
            not differ from that of prose, there is a numerous class of critics who, when they
            stumble upon these prosaisms as they call them, imagine that they have made a notable
            discovery, and exult over the Poet as over a man ignorant of his own profession. Now
            these men would establish a canon of criticism which the Reader will conclude he must
            utterly reject if he wishes to be pleased with these volumes. And it would be a most
            easy task to prove to him that not only the language of a large portion of every good
            poem, even of the most elevated character, must necessarily, except with reference to
            the metre, in no respect differ from that of good prose, but likewise that some of the
            most interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly the language of
            prose when prose is well written. The truth of this assertion might be demonstrated by
            innumerable passages from almost all the poetical writings, even of Milton himself. I
            have not space for much quotation; but, to illustrate the subject in a general manner, I
            will here adduce a short composition of Gray, who was at the head of those who by their
            reasonings have attempted to widen the space of separation betwixt Prose and Metrical
            composition, and was more than any other man curiously elaborate in the structure of his
            own poetic diction. </p>

         <p>It will easily be perceived that the only part of this Sonnet which is of any value is
            the lines printed in Italics: it is equally obvious that except in the rhyme, and in the
            use of the single word “fruitless” for fruitlessly, which is so far a defect, the
            language of these lines does in no respect differ from that of prose. </p>
         <p>Is there then, it will be asked, no essential difference between the language of prose
            and metrical composition? I answer that there neither is nor can be any essential
            difference. We are fond of tracing the resemblance between Poetry and Painting, and,
            accordingly, we call them Sisters: but where shall we find bonds of connection
            sufficiently strict to typify the affinity betwixt metrical and prose composition? They
            both speak by and to the same organs; the bodies in which both of them are clothed may
            be said to be of the same substance, their affections are kindred and almost identical,
            not necessarily differing even in degree; Poetry <span class="noteRef">[2]</span> sheds
            no tears “such as Angels weep,” but natural and human tears; she can boast of no
            celestial Ichor that distinguishes her vital juices from those of prose; the same human
            blood circulates through the veins of them both. </p>
         <span class="footNote">[Footnote 2: I here use the word “Poetry” (though against my own
            judgment) as opposed to the word Prose, and synonomous with metrical composition. But
            much confusion has been introduced into criticism by this contradistinction of Poetry
            and Prose, instead of the more philosophical one of Poetry and Science. The only strict
            antithesis to Prose is Metre.]</span>
         <p>If it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrangement of themselves constitute a
            distinction which overturns what I have been saying on the strict affinity of metrical
            language with that of prose, and paves the way for other distinctions which the mind
            voluntarily admits, I answer that the distinction of rhyme and metre is regular and
            uniform, and not, like that which is produced by what is usually called poetic diction,
            arbitrary and subject to infinite caprices upon which no calculation whatever can be
            made. In the one case the Reader is utterly at the mercy of the Poet respecting what
            imagery or diction he may choose to connect with the passion, whereas in the other the
            metre obeys certain laws, to which the Poet and Reader both willingly submit because
            they are certain, and because no interference is made by them with the passion but such
            as the concurring testimony of ages has shewn to heighten and improve the pleasure which
            co-exists with it. It will now be proper to answer an obvious question, namely, why,
            professing these opinions have I written in verse? To this in the first place I reply,
            because, however I may have restricted myself, there is still left open to me what
            confessedly constitutes the most valuable object of all writing whether in prose or
            verse, the great and universal passions of men, the most general and interesting of
            their occupations, and the entire world of nature, from which I am at liberty to supply
            myself with endless combinations of forms and imagery. Now, granting for a moment that
            whatever is interesting in these objects may be as vividly described in prose, why am I
            to be condemned if to such description I have endeavoured to superadd the charm which by
            the consent of all nations is acknowledged to exist in metrical language? To this it
            will be answered, that a very small part of the pleasure given by Poetry depends upon
            the metre, and that it is injudicious to write in metre unless it be accompanied with
            the other artificial distinctions of style with which metre is usually accompanied, and
            that by such deviation more will be lost from the shock which will be thereby given to
            the Reader’s associations than will be counterbalanced by any pleasure which he can
            derive from the general power of numbers. In answer to those who thus contend for the
            necessity of accompanying metre with certain appropriate colours of style in order to
            the accomplishment of its appropriate end, and who also, in my opinion, greatly
            under-rate the power of metre in itself, it might perhaps be almost sufficient to
            observe that poems are extant, written upon more humble subjects, and in a more naked
            and simple style than what I have aimed at, which poems have continued to give pleasure
            from generation to generation. Now, if nakedness and simplicity be a defect, the fact
            here mentioned affords a strong presumption that poems somewhat less naked and simple
            are capable of affording pleasure at the present day; and all that I am now attempting
            is to justify myself for having written under the impression of this belief. </p>
         <p>But I might point out various causes why, when the style is manly, and the subject of
            some importance, words metrically arranged will long continue to impart such a pleasure
            to mankind as he who is sensible of the extent of that pleasure will be desirous to
            impart. The end of Poetry is to produce excitement in coexistence with an overbalance of
            pleasure. Now, by the supposition, excitement is an unusual and irregular state of the
            mind; ideas and feelings do not in that state succeed each other in accustomed order.
            But if the words by which this excitement is produced are in themselves powerful, or the
            images and feelings have an undue proportion of pain connected with them, there is some
            danger that the excitement may be carried beyond its proper bounds. Now the co-presence
            of something regular, something to which the mind has been accustomed when in an
            unexcited or a less excited state, cannot but have great efficacy in tempering and
            restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling. This may be illustrated
            by appealing to the Reader’s own experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the
            re-perusal of the distressful parts of Clarissa Harlowe, or the Gamester. While
            Shakespeare’s writings, in the most pathetic scenes, never act upon us as pathetic
            beyond the bounds of pleasure—an effect which is in a great degree to be ascribed to
            small, but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical
            arrangement.—On the other hand (what it must be allowed will much more frequently
            happen) if the Poet’s words should be incommensurate with the passion, and inadequate to
            raise the Reader to a height of desirable excitement, then, (unless the Poet’s choice of
            his metre has been grossly injudicious) in the feelings of pleasure which the Reader has
            been accustomed to connect with metre in general, and in the feeling, whether chearful
            or melancholy, which he has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement of
            metre, there will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart passion to
            the words, and to effect the complex end which the Poet proposes to himself. </p>
         <p>If I had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory upon which these poems are
            written, it would have been my duty to develope the various causes upon which the
            pleasure received from metrical language depends. Among the chief of these causes is to
            be reckoned a principle which must be well known to those who have made any of the Arts
            the object of accurate reflection; I mean the pleasure which the mind derives from the
            perception of similitude in dissimilitude. This principle is the great spring of the
            activity of our minds and their chief feeder. From this principle the direction of the
            sexual appetite, and all the passions connected with it take their origin: It is the
            life of our ordinary conversation; and upon the accuracy with which similitude in
            dissimilitude, and dissimilitude in similitude are perceived, depend our taste and our
            moral feelings. It would not have been a useless employment to have applied this
            principle to the consideration of metre, and to have shewn that metre is hence enabled
            to afford much pleasure, and to have pointed out in what manner that pleasure is
            produced. But my limits will not permit me to enter upon this subject, and I must
            content myself with a general summary. </p>
         <p> I have said that Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its
            origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity: the emotion is contemplated till by a
            species of reaction the tranquillity gradually disappears, and an emotion, similar to
            that which was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does
            itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood successful composition generally begins,
            and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; but the emotion, of whatever kind and in
            whatever degree, from various causes is qualified by various pleasures, so that in
            describing any passions whatsoever, which are voluntarily described, the mind will upon
            the whole be in a state of enjoyment. Now if Nature be thus cautious in preserving in a
            state of enjoyment a being thus employed, the Poet ought to profit by the lesson thus
            held forth to him, and ought especially to take care, that whatever passions he
            communicates to his Reader, those passions, if his Reader’s mind be sound and vigorous,
            should always be accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure. Now the music of
            harmonious metrical language, the sense of difficulty overcome, and the blind
            association of pleasure which has been previously received from works of rhyme or metre
            of the same or similar construction, all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling
            of delight, which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling which
            will always be found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper passions.
            This effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned poetry; while in lighter
            compositions the ease and gracefulness with which the Poet manages his numbers are
            themselves confessedly a principal source of the gratification of the Reader. I might
            perhaps include all which it is necessary to say upon this subject by affirming what few
            persons will deny, that of two descriptions either of passions, manners, or characters,
            each of them equally well executed, the one in prose and the other in verse, the verse
            will be read a hundred times where the prose is read once. We see that Pope by the power
            of verse alone, has contrived to render the plainest common sense interesting, and even
            frequently to invest it with the appearance of passion. In consequence of these
            convictions I related in metre the Tale of GOODY BLAKE and HARRY GILL, which is one of
            the rudest of this collection. I wished to draw attention to the truth that the power of
            the human imagination is sufficient to produce such changes even in our physical nature
            as might almost appear miraculous. The truth is an important one; the fact (for it is a
            fact) is a valuable illustration of it. And I have the satisfaction of knowing that it
            has been communicated to many hundreds of people who would never have heard of it, had
            it not been narrated as a Ballad, and in a more impressive metre than is usual in
            Ballads. </p>
         <p>Having thus adverted to a few of the reasons why I have written in verse, and why I have
            chosen subjects from common life, and endeavoured to bring my language near to the real
            language of men, if I have been too minute in pleading my own cause, I have at the same
            time been treating a subject of general interest; and it is for this reason that I
            request the Reader’s permission to add a few words with reference solely to these
            particular poems, and to some defects which will probably be found in them. I am
            sensible that my associations must have sometimes been particular instead of general,
            and that, consequently, giving to things a false importance, sometimes from diseased
            impulses I may have written upon unworthy subject; but I am less apprehensive on this
            account, than that my language may frequently have suffered from those arbitrary
            connections of feelings and ideas with particular words, from which no man can
            altogether protect himself. Hence I have no doubt that in some instances feelings even
            of the ludicrous may be given to my Readers by expressions which appeared to me tender
            and pathetic. Such faulty expressions, were I convinced they were faulty at present, and
            that they must necessarily continue to be so, I would willingly take all reasonable
            pains to correct. But it is dangerous to make these alterations on the simple authority
            of a few individuals, or even of certain classes of men; for where the understanding of
            an Author is not convinced, or his feelings altered, this cannot be done without great
            injury to himself: for his own feelings are his stay and support, and if he sets them
            aside in one instance, he may be induced to repeat this act till his mind loses all
            confidence in itself and becomes utterly debilitated. To this it may be added, that the
            Reader ought never to forget that he is himself exposed to the same errors as the Poet,
            and perhaps in a much greater degree: for there can be no presumption in saying that it
            is not probable he will be so well acquainted with the various stages of meaning through
            which words have passed, or with the fickleness or stability of the relations of
            particular ideas to each other; and above all, since he is so much less interested in
            the subject, he may decide lightly and carelessly. </p>
         <p>Long as I have detained my Reader, I hope he will permit me to caution him against a
            mode of false criticism which has been applied to Poetry in which the language closely
            resembles that of life and nature. Such verses have been triumphed over in parodies of
            which Dr. Johnson’s Stanza is a fair specimen. </p>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">“I put my hat upon my head, </div>
            <div class="line">And walk’d into the Strand, </div>
            <div class="line">And there I met another man </div>
            <div class="line">Whose hat was in his hand.” </div>
         </div>
         <p>Immediately under these lines I will place one of the most justly admired stanzas of the
            “Babes in the Wood.” </p>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">“These pretty Babes with hand in hand </div>
            <div class="line">Went wandering up and down; </div>
            <div class="line">But never more they saw the Man </div>
            <div class="line">Approaching from the Town.” </div>
         </div>
         <p>In both of these stanzas the words, and the order of the words, in no respect differ
            from the most unimpassioned conversation. There are words in both, for example, “the
            Strand,” and “the Town,” connected with none but the most familiar ideas; yet the one
            stanza we admit as admirable, and the other as a fair example of the superlatively
            contemptible. Whence arises this difference? Not from the metre, not from the language,
            not from the order of the words; but the matter expressed in Dr. Johnson’s stanza is
            contemptible. The proper method of treating trivial and simple verses to which Dr.
            Johnson’s stanza would be a fair parallelism is not to say this is a bad kind of poetry,
            or this is not poetry, but this wants sense; it is neither interesting in itself, nor
            can lead to any thing interesting; the images neither originate in that sane state of
            feeling which arises out of thought, nor can excite thought or feeling in the Reader.
            This is the only sensible manner of dealing with such verses: Why trouble yourself about
            the species till you have previously decided upon the genus? Why take pains to prove
            that an Ape is not a Newton when it is self-evident that he is not a man. </p>
         <p> I have one request to make of my Reader, which is, that in judging these Poems he would
            decide by his own feelings genuinely, and not by reflection upon what will probably be
            the judgment of others. How common is it to hear a person say, “I myself do not object
            to this style of composition or this or that expression, but to such and such classes of
            people it will appear mean or ludicrous.” This mode of criticism so destructive of all
            sound unadulterated judgment is almost universal: I have therefore to request that the
            Reader would abide independently by his own feelings, and that if he finds himself
            affected he would not suffer such conjectures to interfere with his pleasure. </p>
         <p>If an Author by any single composition has impressed us with respect for his talents, it
            is useful to consider this as affording a presumption, that, on other occasions where we
            have been displeased, he nevertheless may not have written ill or absurdly; and,
            further, to give him so much credit for this one composition as may induce us to review
            what has displeased us with more care than we should otherwise have bestowed upon it.
            This is not only an act of justice, but in our decisions upon poetry especially, may
            conduce in a high degree to the improvement of our own taste: for an accurate taste in
            Poetry and in all the other arts, as Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed, is an acquired
            talent, which can only be produced by thought and a long continued intercourse with the
            best models of composition. This is mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as to
            prevent the most inexperienced Reader from judging for himself, (I have already said
            that I wish him to judge for himself;) but merely to temper the rashness of decision,
            and to suggest that if Poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed, the
            judgment may be erroneous, and that in many cases it necessarily will be so. </p>
         <p> I know that nothing would have so effectually contributed to further the end which I
            have in view as to have shewn of what kind the pleasure is, and how the pleasure is
            produced which is confessedly produced by metrical composition essentially different
            from what I have here endeavoured to recommend; for the Reader will say that he has been
            pleased by such composition and what can I do more for him? The power of any art is
            limited and he will suspect that if I propose to furnish him with new friends it is only
            upon condition of his abandoning his old friends. Besides, as I have said, the Reader is
            himself conscious of the pleasure which he has received from such composition,
            composition to which he has peculiarly attached the endearing name of Poetry; and all
            men feel an habitual gratitude, and something of an honorable bigotry for the objects
            which have long continued to please them: we not only wish to be pleased, but to be
            pleased in that particular way in which we have been accustomed to be pleased. There is
            a host of arguments in these feelings; and I should be the less able to combat them
            successfully, as I am willing to allow, that, in order entirely to enjoy the Poetry
            which I am recommending, it would be necessary to give up much of what is ordinarily
            enjoyed. But would my limits have permitted me to point out how this pleasure is
            produced, I might have removed many obstacles, and assisted my Reader in perceiving that
            the powers of language are not so limited as he may suppose; and that it is possible
            that poetry may give other enjoyments, of a purer, more lasting, and more exquisite
            nature. But this part of my subject I have been obliged altogether to omit: as it has
            been less my present aim to prove that the interest excited by some other kinds of
            poetry is less vivid, and less worthy of the nobler powers of the mind, than to offer
            reasons for presuming, that, if the object which I have proposed to myself were
            adequately attained, a species of poetry would be produced, which is genuine poetry; in
            its nature well adapted to interest mankind permanently, and likewise important in the
            multiplicity and quality of its moral relations. From what has been said, and from a
            perusal of the Poems, the Reader will be able clearly to perceive the object which I
            have proposed to myself: he will determine how far I have attained this object; and,
            what is a much more important question, whether it be worth attaining; and upon the
            decision of these two questions will rest my claim to the approbation of the public.

         <h2>THE COMPLAINT</h2>
         <h3>OF A FORSAKEN</h3>
         <h2>INDIAN WOMAN.</h2>
         <div class="footNote">[When a Northern Indian, from sickness, is unable to continue his
            journey with his companions; he is left behind, covered over with Deer-skins, and is
            supplied with water, food, and fuel if the situation of the place will afford it. He is
            informed of the track which his companions intend to pursue, and if he is unable to
            follow, or overtake them, he perishes alone in the Desart; unless he should have the
            good fortune to fall in with some other Tribes of Indians. It is unnecessary to add that
            the females are equally, or still more, exposed to the same fate. See that very
            interesting work, Hearne’s Journey from Hudson’s Bay to the Northern Ocean. In the high
            Northern Latititudes, as the same writer informs us, when the Northern Lights vary their
            position in the air, they make a rustling and a crackling noise. This circumstance is
            alluded to in the first stanza of the following poem.] </div>

            <div class="line">With its dark arms to form a circling bower, </div>
            <div class="line"> I well remember.—He was one who owned </div>
            <div class="line">No common soul. In youth by science nursed </div>
            <div class="line">And led by nature into a wild scene </div>
            <div class="line">Of lofty hopes, he to the world went forth, </div>
            <div class="line"> A favored being, knowing no desire </div>
            <div class="line">Which genius did not hallow, ’gainst the taint </div>
            <div class="line">Of dissolute tongues, and jealousy, and hate </div>
            <div class="line">And scorn, against all enemies prepared. </div>
            <div class="line">All but neglect. The world, for so it thought, </div>
            <div class="line">Owed him no service: he was like a plant </div>
            <div class="line">Fair to the sun, the darling of the winds, </div>
            <div class="line">But hung with fruit which no one, that passed by, </div>
            <div class="line">Regarded, and, his spirit damped at once, </div>
            <div class="line">With indignation did he turn away </div>
            <div class="line">And with the food of pride sustained his soul </div>
            <div class="line">In solitude.—Stranger! these gloomy boughs </div>
            <div class="line">Had charms for him; and here he loved to sit, </div>
            <div class="line">His only visitants a straggling sheep, </div>
            <div class="line">The stone-chat, or the glancing sand-piper; </div>
            <div class="line">And on these barren rocks, with juniper, </div>
            <div class="line">And heath, and thistle, thinly sprinkled o’er, </div>
            <div class="line">Fixing his downcast eye, he many an hour </div>
            <div class="line"> A morbid pleasure nourished, tracing here </div>
            <div class="line">An emblem of his own unfruitful life: </div>
            <div class="line">And lifting up his head, he then would gaze </div>
            <div class="line">On the more distant scene; how lovely ’tis </div>
            <div class="line">Thou seest, and he would gaze till it became </div>
            <div class="line">Far lovelier, and his heart could not sustain </div>
            <div class="line">The beauty still more beauteous. Nor, that time </div>
            <div class="line">When Nature had subdued him to herself </div>
            <div class="line">Would he forget those beings, to whose minds, </div>
            <div class="line">Warm from the labours of benevolence, </div>
            <div class="line">The world, and man himself, appeared a scene </div>
            <div class="line">Of kindred loveliness: then he would sigh </div>
            <div class="line">With mournful joy, to think that others felt </div>
            <div class="line">What he must never feel: and so, lost man! </div>
            <div class="line">On visionary views would fancy feed, </div>
            <div class="line">Till his eye streamed with tears. In this deep vale </div>
            <div class="line">He died, this seat his only monument. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">If thou be one whose heart the holy forms </div>
            <div class="line">Of young imagination have kept pure, </div>
            <div class="line">Stranger! henceforth be warned; and know, that pride, </div>
            <div class="line">Howe’er disguised in its own majesty, </div>
            <div class="line">Is littleness; that he, who feels contempt </div>
            <div class="line">For any living thing, hath faculties </div>
            <div class="line">Which he has never used; that thought with him </div>
            <div class="line">Is in its infancy. The man, whose eye </div>

            <div class="line">The least of nature’s works, one who might move </div>
            <div class="line">The wise man to that scorn which wisdom holds </div>
            <div class="line">Unlawful, ever. O, be wiser thou! </div>
            <div class="line">Instructed that true knowledge leads to love, </div>
            <div class="line">True dignity abides with him alone </div>
            <div class="line">Who, in the silent hour of inward thought, </div>

         <h4>FOSTER-MOTHER.</h4>
         <div class="line">Can no one hear? It is a perilous tale! </div>

         <h4>FOSTER-MOTHER.</h4>
         <div class="line">
            <span class="indent_5">My husband’s father told it me,</span>
         </div>
         <div class="line">Poor old Leoni!—Angels rest his soul! </div>
         <div class="line">He was a woodman, and could fell and saw </div>
         <div class="line">With lusty arm. You know that huge round beam </div>
         <div class="line">Which props the hanging wall of the old chapel? </div>
         <div class="line">Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree </div>
         <div class="line">He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined </div>
         <div class="line">With thistle beards, and such small locks of wool </div>
         <div class="line">As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home, </div>
         <div class="line">And reared him at the then Lord Velez’ cost. </div>
         <div class="line">And so the babe grew up a pretty boy, </div>
         <div class="line"> A pretty boy, but most unteachable— </div>
         <div class="line">And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead. </div>
         <div class="line">But knew the names of birds, and mocked their notes, </div>
         <div class="line">And whistled, as he were a bird himself: </div>
         <div class="line">And all the autumn ’twas his only play </div>
         <div class="line">To get the seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them </div>
         <div class="line">With earth and water, on the stumps of trees. </div>
         <div class="line"> A Friar, who gathered simples in the wood, </div>
         <div class="line"> A grey-haired man—he loved this little boy, </div>
         <div class="line">The boy loved him—and, when the Friar taught him, </div>
         <div class="line">He soon could write with the pen: and from that time, </div>
         <div class="line">Lived chiefly at the Convent or the Castle. </div>
         <div class="line">So he became a very learned youth. </div>
         <div class="line">But Oh! poor wretch!—he read, and read, and read, </div>
         <div class="line">Till his brain turned—and ere his twentieth year, </div>
         <div class="line">He had unlawful thoughts of many things: </div>
         <div class="line">And though he prayed, he never loved to pray </div>
         <div class="line">With holy men, nor in a holy place— </div>
         <div class="line">But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet, </div>
         <div class="line">The late Lord Velez ne’er was wearied with him. </div>
         <div class="line">And once, as by the north side of the Chapel </div>
         <div class="line">They stood together, chained in deep discourse, </div>
         <div class="line">The earth heaved under them with such a groan, </div>
         <div class="line">That the wall tottered, and had well-nigh fallen </div>
         <div class="line">Right on their heads. My Lord was sorely frightened; </div>
         <div class="line"> A fever seized him, and he made confession </div>
         <div class="line">Of all the heretical and lawless talk </div>
         <div class="line">Which brought this judgment: so the youth was seized </div>
         <div class="line">And cast into that cell. My husband’s father </div>
         <div class="line">Sobbed like a child—it almost broke his heart: </div>
         <div class="line">And once as he was working in the cellar, </div>
         <div class="line">He heard a voice distinctly; ’twas the youth’s </div>
         <div class="line">Who sang a doleful song about green fields, </div>
         <div class="line">How sweet it were on lake or wild savannah, </div>
         <div class="line">To hunt for food, and be a naked man, </div>
         <div class="line">And wander up and down at liberty. </div>
         <div class="line">Leoni doted on the youth, and now </div>
         <div class="line">His love grew desperate; and defying death, </div>
         <div class="line">He made that cunning entrance I described: </div>
         <div class="line">And the young man escaped. </div>
         <h4>MARIA.</h4>
         <div class="line">
            <span class="indent_15">’Tis a sweet tale.</span>
         </div>
         <div class="line">And what became of him? </div>
         <h4>FOSTER-MOTHER.</h4>
         <div class="line">
            <span class="indent_15">He went on ship-board</span>
         </div>
         <div class="line">With those bold voyagers, who made discovery </div>
         <div class="line">Of golden lands. Leoni’s younger brother </div>
         <div class="line">Went likewise, and when he returned to Spain, </div>
         <div class="line">He told Leoni, that the poor mad youth, </div>
         <div class="line">Soon after they arrived in that new world, </div>
         <div class="line">In spite of his dissuasion, seized a boat, </div>
         <div class="line">And all alone, set sail by silent moonlight </div>
         <div class="line">Up a great river, great as any sea, </div>
         <div class="line">And ne’er was heard of more: but ’tis supposed, </div>
         <div class="line">He lived and died among the savage men. </div>

            <div class="line">What is’t that ails young Harry Gill? </div>
            <div class="line">That evermore his teeth they chatter, </div>
            <div class="line">Chatter, chatter, chatter still. </div>
            <div class="line">Of waistcoats Harry has no lack, </div>
            <div class="line">Good duffle grey, and flannel fine; </div>
            <div class="line">He has a blanket on his back, </div>
            <div class="line">And coats enough to smother nine. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">In March, December, and in July, </div>
            <div class="line">’Tis all the same with Harry Gill; </div>
            <div class="line">The neighbours tell, and tell you truly, </div>
            <div class="line">His teeth they chatter, chatter still. </div>
            <div class="line">At night, at morning, and at noon, </div>
            <div class="line">’Tis all the same with Harry Gill; </div>
            <div class="line">Beneath the sun, beneath the moon, </div>
            <div class="line">His teeth they chatter, chatter still. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Young Harry was a lusty drover, </div>
            <div class="line">And who so stout of limb as he? </div>
            <div class="line">His cheeks were red as ruddy clover, </div>
            <div class="line">His voice was like the voice of three. </div>
            <div class="line">Auld Goody Blake was old and poor, </div>
            <div class="line">Ill fed she was, and thinly clad; </div>
            <div class="line">And any man who pass’d her door, </div>
            <div class="line">Might see how poor a hut she had. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">All day she spun in her poor dwelling, </div>
            <div class="line">And then her three hours’ work at night! </div>
            <div class="line">Alas! ’twas hardly worth the telling, </div>
            <div class="line">It would not pay for candle-light. </div>
            <div class="line">—This woman dwelt in Dorsetshire, </div>
            <div class="line">Her hut was on a cold hill-side, </div>
            <div class="line">And in that country coals are dear, </div>
            <div class="line">For they come far by wind and tide. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">By the same fire to boil their pottage, </div>
            <div class="line">Two poor old dames as I have known, </div>
            <div class="line">Will often live in one small cottage, </div>
            <div class="line">But she, poor woman, dwelt alone. </div>
            <div class="line">’Twas well enough when summer came, </div>
            <div class="line">The long, warm, lightsome summer-day, </div>
            <div class="line">Then at her door the canty dame </div>
            <div class="line">Would sit, as any linnet gay. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">But when the ice our streams did fetter, </div>
            <div class="line">Oh! then how her old bones would shake! </div>
            <div class="line">You would have said, if you had met her, </div>
            <div class="line">’Twas a hard time for Goody Blake. </div>
            <div class="line">Her evenings then were dull and dead; </div>
            <div class="line">Sad case it was, as you may think, </div>
            <div class="line">For very cold to go to bed, </div>
            <div class="line">And then for cold not sleep a wink. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Oh joy for her! whene’er in winter </div>
            <div class="line">The winds at night had made a rout, </div>
            <div class="line">And scatter’d many a lusty splinter, </div>
            <div class="line">And many a rotten bough about. </div>
            <div class="line">Yet never had she, well or sick, </div>
            <div class="line">As every man who knew her says, </div>
            <div class="line"> A pile before hand, wood or stick, </div>
            <div class="line">Enough to warm her for three days. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Now when the frost was past enduring, </div>
            <div class="line">And made her poor old bones to ache, </div>
            <div class="line">Could any thing be more alluring, </div>
            <div class="line">Than an old hedge to Goody Blake? </div>
            <div class="line">And now and then, it must be said, </div>
            <div class="line">When her old bones were cold and chill, </div>
            <div class="line">She left her fire, or left her bed, </div>
            <div class="line">To seek the hedge of Harry Gill. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Now Harry he had long suspected </div>
            <div class="line">This trespass of old Goody Blake, </div>
            <div class="line">And vow’d that she should be detected, </div>
            <div class="line">And he on her would vengeance take. </div>
            <div class="line">And oft from his warm fire he’d go, </div>
            <div class="line">And to the fields his road would take, </div>
            <div class="line">And there, at night, in frost and snow, </div>
            <div class="line">He watch’d to seize old Goody Blake. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And once, behind a rick of barley, </div>
            <div class="line">Thus looking out did Harry stand; </div>
            <div class="line">The moon was full and shining clearly, </div>
            <div class="line">And crisp with frost the stubble land. </div>
            <div class="line">—He hears a noise—he’s all awake— </div>
            <div class="line">Again?—on tip-toe down the hill </div>
            <div class="line">He softly creeps—’Tis Goody Blake, </div>
            <div class="line">She’s at the hedge of Harry Gill. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Right glad was he when he beheld her; </div>
            <div class="line">Stick after stick did Goody pull, </div>
            <div class="line">He stood behind a bush of elder, </div>
            <div class="line">Till she had filled her apron full. </div>
            <div class="line">When with her load she turned about, </div>
            <div class="line">The bye-road back again to take, </div>
            <div class="line">He started forward with a shout, </div>
            <div class="line">And sprang upon poor Goody Blake. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And fiercely by the arm he took her, </div>
            <div class="line">And by the arm he held her fast, </div>
            <div class="line">And fiercely by the arm he shook her, </div>
            <div class="line">And cried, “I’ve caught you then at last!” </div>
            <div class="line">Then Goody, who had nothing said, </div>
            <div class="line">Her bundle from her lap let fall; </div>
            <div class="line">And kneeling on the sticks, she pray’d </div>
            <div class="line">To God that is the judge of all. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">She pray’d, her wither’d hand uprearing, </div>

            <div class="line">The cold, cold moon above her head, </div>
            <div class="line">Thus on her knees did Goody pray, </div>
            <div class="line">Young Harry heard what she had said; </div>
            <div class="line">And icy-cold he turned away. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">He went complaining all the morrow </div>
            <div class="line">That he was cold and very chill: </div>
            <div class="line">His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow, </div>
            <div class="line">Alas! that day for Harry Gill! </div>
            <div class="line">That day he wore a riding-coat, </div>

            <div class="line">Another was on Thursday brought, </div>
            <div class="line">And ere the Sabbath he had three. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">’Twas all in vain, a useless matter, </div>
            <div class="line">And blankets were about him pinn’d; </div>
            <div class="line">Yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter, </div>
            <div class="line">Like a loose casement in the wind. </div>
            <div class="line">And Harry’s flesh it fell away; </div>
            <div class="line">And all who see him say ’tis plain, </div>
            <div class="line">That, live as long as live he may, </div>
            <div class="line">He never will be warm again. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">No word to any man he utters, </div>
            <div class="line"> A-bed or up, to young or old; </div>
            <div class="line">But ever to himself he mutters, </div>

            <div class="line"> A-bed or up, by night or day; </div>
            <div class="line">His teeth they chatter, chatter still. </div>

         <div class="lg">
            <h4>I.</h4>
            <div class="line">There is a thorn; it looks so old, </div>
            <div class="line">In truth you’d find it hard to say, </div>
            <div class="line">How it could ever have been young, </div>
            <div class="line">It looks so old and grey. </div>
            <div class="line">Not higher than a two years’ child </div>
            <div class="line">It stands erect this aged thorn; </div>
            <div class="line">No leaves it has, no thorny points; </div>
            <div class="line">It is a mass of knotted joints, </div>
            <div class="line"> A wretched thing forlorn. </div>
            <div class="line">It stands erect, and like a stone </div>
            <div class="line">With lichens it is overgrown. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <h4>II.</h4>
            <div class="line">Like rock or stone, it is o’ergrown </div>
            <div class="line">With lichens to the very top, </div>
            <div class="line">And hung with heavy tufts of moss, </div>
            <div class="line"> A melancholy crop: </div>
            <div class="line">Up from the earth these mosses creep, </div>
            <div class="line">And this poor thorn! they clasp it round </div>
            <div class="line">So close, you’d say that they were bent </div>
            <div class="line">With plain and manifest intent, </div>
            <div class="line">To drag it to the ground; </div>
            <div class="line">And all had join’d in one endeavour </div>
            <div class="line">To bury this poor thorn for ever. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <h4>III.</h4>
            <div class="line">High on a mountain’s highest ridge, </div>
            <div class="line">Where oft the stormy winter gale </div>
            <div class="line">Cuts like a scythe, while through the clouds </div>
            <div class="line">It sweeps from vale to vale; </div>
            <div class="line">Not five yards from the mountain-path, </div>
            <div class="line">This thorn you on your left espy; </div>
            <div class="line">And to the left, three yards beyond, </div>
            <div class="line">You see a little muddy pond </div>
            <div class="line">Of water, never dry; </div>
            <div class="line"> I’ve measured it from side to side: </div>
            <div class="line">’Tis three feet long, and two feet wide. </div>

            <div class="line">And mossy network too is there, </div>
            <div class="line">As if by hand of lady fair </div>

            <div class="line">And cups, the darlings of the eye, </div>
            <div class="line">So deep is their vermillion dye. </div>

         <div class="lg">
            <h4>V.</h4>
            <div class="line">Ah me! what lovely tints are there! </div>
            <div class="line">Of olive green and scarlet bright, </div>
            <div class="line">In spikes, in branches, and in stars, </div>
            <div class="line">Green, red, and pearly white. </div>
            <div class="line">This heap of earth o’ergrown with moss, </div>
            <div class="line">Which close beside the thorn you see, </div>
            <div class="line">So fresh in all its beauteous dyes, </div>
            <div class="line">Is like an infant’s grave in size </div>
            <div class="line">As like as like can be: </div>
            <div class="line">But never, never any where, </div>
            <div class="line">An infant’s grave was half so fair. </div>

            <div class="line">Now would you see this aged thorn, </div>
            <div class="line">This pond and beauteous hill of moss, </div>
            <div class="line">You must take care and chuse your time </div>
            <div class="line">The mountain when to cross. </div>

            <div class="line">And that same pond of which I spoke, </div>
            <div class="line"> A woman in a scarlet cloak, </div>

            <div class="line">The spot to which she goes; </div>
            <div class="line">The heap that’s like an infant’s grave, </div>

            <p>NOTE to THE THORN</p>
            <p>—This Poem ought to have been preceded by an introductory Poem, which I have been
               prevented from writing by never having felt myself in a mood when it was probable
               that I should write it well.—The character which I have here introduced speaking is
               sufficiently common. The Reader will perhaps have a general notion of it, if he has
               ever known a man, a Captain of a small trading vessel for example, who being past the
               middle age of life, had retired upon an annuity or small independent income to some
               village or country town of which he was not a native, or in which he had not been
               accustomed to live. Such men having little to do become credulous and talkative from
               indolence; and from the same cause, and other predisposing causes by which it is
               probable that such men may have been affected, they are prone to superstition. On
               which account it appeared to me proper to select a character like this to exhibit
               some of the general laws by which superstition acts upon the mind. Superstitious men
               are almost always men of slow faculties and deep feelings; their minds are not loose
               but adhesive; they have a reasonable share of imagination, by which word I mean the
               faculty which produces impressive effects out of simple elements; but they are
               utterly destitute of fancy, the power by which pleasure and surprize are excited by
               sudden varieties of situation and by accumulated imagery. </p>
            <p>It was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such men cleave to the same
               ideas; and to follow the turns of passion, always different, yet not palpably
               different, by which their conversation is swayed. I had two objects to attain; first,
               to represent a picture which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with the
               character that should describe it, secondly, while I adhered to the style in which
               such persons describe, to take care that words, which in their minds are impregnated
               with passion, should likewise convey passion to Readers who are not accustomed to
               sympathize with men feeling in that manner or using such language. It seemed to me
               that this might be done by calling in the assistance of Lyrical and rapid Metre. It
               was necessary that the Poem, to be natural, should in reality move slowly; yet I
               hoped, that, by the aid of the metre, to those who should at all enter into the
               spirit of the Poem, it would appear to move quickly. The Reader will have the
               kindness to excuse this note as I am sensible that an introductory Poem is necessary
               to give this Poem its full effect. </p>
            <p>Upon this occasion I will request permission to add a few words closely connected
               with THE THORN and many other Poems in these Volumes. There is a numerous class of
               readers who imagine that the same words cannot be repeated without tautology: this is
               a great error: virtual tautology is much oftener produced by using different words
               when the meaning is exactly the same. Words, a Poet’s words more particularly, ought
               to be weighed in the balance of feeling and not measured by the space which they
               occupy upon paper. For the Reader cannot be too often reminded that Poetry is
               passion: it is the history or science of feelings: now every man must know that an
               attempt is rarely made to communicate impassioned feelings without something of an
               accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness of our own powers, or the
               deficiencies of language. During such efforts there will be a craving in the mind,
               and as long as it is unsatisfied the Speaker will cling to the same words, or words
               of the same character. There are also various other reasons why repetition and
               apparent tautology are frequently beauties of the highest kind. Among the chief of
               these reasons is the interest which the mind attaches to words, not only as symbols
               of the passion, but as things, active and efficient, which are of themselves part of
               the passion. And further, from a spirit of fondness, exultation, and gratitude, the
               mind luxuriates in the repetition of words which appear successfully to communicate
               its feelings. The truth of these remarks might be shewn by innumerable passages from
               the Bible and from the impassioned poetry of every nation. </p>

            <div class="line">“Why this is strange,” said I. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">“For, here are woods and green hills warm: </div>
            <div class="line">There surely must some reason be </div>
            <div class="line">Why you would change sweet Liswyn farm, </div>

            <div class="line">At this, my boy hung down his head, </div>
            <div class="line">He blush’d with shame, nor made reply; </div>
            <div class="line">And five times to the child I said, </div>
            <div class="line">“Why, Edward, tell me, why?” </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">His head he raised—there was in sight, </div>
            <div class="line">It caught his eye, he saw it plain— </div>
            <div class="line">Upon the house-top, glittering bright, </div>
            <div class="line"> A broad and gilded vane. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Then did the boy his tongue unlock, </div>
            <div class="line">And thus to me he made reply; </div>
            <div class="line">“At Kilve there was no weather-cock, </div>
            <div class="line">And that’s the reason why.” </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Oh dearest, dearest boy! my heart </div>
            <div class="line">For better lore would seldom yearn </div>
            <div class="line">Could I but teach the hundredth part </div>

            <div class="line">By Derwent’s side my Father’s cottage stood, </div>
            <div class="line">(The Woman thus her artless story told) </div>
            <div class="line">One field, a flock, and what the neighbouring flood </div>
            <div class="line">Supplied, to him were more than mines of gold. </div>
            <div class="line">Light was my sleep; my days in transport roll’d: </div>
            <div class="line">With thoughtless joy I stretch’d along the shore </div>
            <div class="line">My father’s nets, or from the mountain fold </div>
            <div class="line">Saw on the distant lake his twinkling oar </div>
            <div class="line">Or watch’d his lazy boat still less’ning more and more </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">My father was a good and pious man, </div>
            <div class="line">An honest man by honest parents bred, </div>
            <div class="line">And I believe that, soon as I began </div>
            <div class="line">To lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed, </div>
            <div class="line">And in his hearing there my prayers I said: </div>
            <div class="line">And afterwards, by my good father taught, </div>
            <div class="line"> I read, and loved the books in which I read; </div>
            <div class="line">For books in every neighbouring house I sought, </div>
            <div class="line">And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Can I forget what charms did once adorn </div>
            <div class="line">My garden, stored with pease, and mint, and thyme, </div>
            <div class="line">And rose and lilly for the sabbath morn? </div>
            <div class="line">The sabbath bells, and their delightful chime; </div>
            <div class="line">The gambols and wild freaks at shearing time; </div>
            <div class="line">My hen’s rich nest through long grass scarce espied; </div>
            <div class="line">The cowslip-gathering at May’s dewy prime; </div>
            <div class="line">The swans, that, when I sought the water-side, </div>
            <div class="line">From far to meet me came, spreading their snowy pride. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">The staff I yet remember which upbore </div>

            <div class="line">His seat beneath the honeyed sycamore </div>
            <div class="line">When the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire; </div>
            <div class="line">When market-morning came, the neat attire </div>
            <div class="line">With which, though bent on haste, myself I deck’d; </div>
            <div class="line">My watchful dog, whose starts of furious ire, </div>
            <div class="line">When stranger passed, so often I have check’d; </div>
            <div class="line">The red-breast known for years, which at my casement peck’d. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">The suns of twenty summers danced along,— </div>
            <div class="line">Ah! little marked, how fast they rolled away: </div>
            <div class="line">Then rose a stately hall our woods among, </div>
            <div class="line">And cottage after cottage owned its sway. </div>
            <div class="line">No joy to see a neighbouring house, or stray </div>
            <div class="line">Through pastures not his own, the master took; </div>
            <div class="line">My Father dared his greedy wish gainsay; </div>
            <div class="line">He loved his old hereditary nook, </div>
            <div class="line">And ill could I the thought of such sad parting brook. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">But when he had refused the proffered gold, </div>
            <div class="line">To cruel injuries he became a prey, </div>
            <div class="line">Sore traversed in whate’er he bought and sold: </div>
            <div class="line">His troubles grew upon him day by day, </div>
            <div class="line">Till all his substance fell into decay. </div>
            <div class="line">His little range of water was denied; <span class="noteRef"
               >[3]</span></div>
            <div class="line">All but the bed where his old body lay. </div>
            <div class="line">All, all was seized, and weeping, side by side, </div>
            <div class="line">We sought a home where we uninjured might abide. </div>

         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Can I forget that miserable hour, </div>
            <div class="line">When from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed, </div>
            <div class="line">Peering above the trees, the steeple tower </div>
            <div class="line">That on his marriage-day sweet music made? </div>
            <div class="line">Till then he hoped his bones might there be laid, </div>
            <div class="line">Close by my mother in their native bowers: </div>
            <div class="line">Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed,— </div>
            <div class="line"> I could not pray:—through tears that fell in showers, </div>
            <div class="line">Glimmer’d our dear-loved home, alas! no longer ours! </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">There was a youth whom I had loved so long. </div>
            <div class="line">That when I loved him not I cannot say. </div>
            <div class="line">’Mid the green mountains many and many a song </div>
            <div class="line">We two had sung, like gladsome birds in May. </div>
            <div class="line">When we began to tire of childish play </div>
            <div class="line">We seemed still more and more to prize each other; </div>
            <div class="line">We talked of marriage and our marriage day; </div>
            <div class="line">And I in truth did love him like a brother, </div>
            <div class="line">For never could I hope to meet with such another. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">His father said, that to a distant town </div>
            <div class="line">He must repair, to ply the artist’s trade. </div>
            <div class="line">What tears of bitter grief till then unknown? </div>
            <div class="line">What tender vows our last sad kiss delayed! </div>
            <div class="line">To him we turned:—we had no other aid. </div>
            <div class="line">Like one revived, upon his neck I wept, </div>
            <div class="line">And her whom he had loved in joy, he said </div>
            <div class="line">He well could love in grief: his faith he kept; </div>
            <div class="line">And in a quiet home once more my father slept. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Four years each day with daily bread was blest, </div>
            <div class="line">By constant toil and constant prayer supplied. </div>
            <div class="line">Three lovely infants lay upon my breast; </div>
            <div class="line">And often, viewing their sweet smiles, I sighed, </div>
            <div class="line">And knew not why. My happy father died </div>
            <div class="line">When sad distress reduced the childrens’ meal: </div>
            <div class="line">Thrice happy! that from him the grave did hide </div>
            <div class="line">The empty loom, cold hearth, and silent wheel, </div>
            <div class="line">And tears that flowed for ills which patience could not heal. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">’Twas a hard change, an evil time was come; </div>
            <div class="line">We had no hope, and no relief could gain. </div>
            <div class="line">But soon, with proud parade, the noisy drum </div>
            <div class="line">Beat round, to sweep the streets of want and pain. </div>
            <div class="line">My husband’s arms now only served to strain </div>
            <div class="line">Me and his children hungering in his view: </div>
            <div class="line">In such dismay my prayers and tears were vain: </div>
            <div class="line">To join those miserable men he flew; </div>
            <div class="line">And now to the sea-coast, with numbers more, we drew. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">There foul neglect for months and months we bore, </div>
            <div class="line">Nor yet the crowded fleet its anchor stirred. </div>
            <div class="line">Green fields before us and our native shore, </div>
            <div class="line">By fever, from polluted air incurred, </div>
            <div class="line">Ravage was made, for which no knell was heard. </div>
            <div class="line">Fondly we wished, and wished away, nor knew, </div>
            <div class="line">’Mid that long sickness, and those hopes deferr’d, </div>
            <div class="line">That happier days we never more must view: </div>
            <div class="line">The parting signal streamed, at last the land withdrew. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">But from delay the summer calms were past. </div>
            <div class="line">On as we drove, the equinoctial deep </div>
            <div class="line">Ran mountains-high before the howling blast. </div>
            <div class="line">We gazed with terror on the gloomy sleep </div>
            <div class="line">Of them that perished in the whirlwind’s sweep, </div>
            <div class="line">Untaught that soon such anguish must ensue, </div>
            <div class="line">Our hopes such harvest of affliction reap, </div>
            <div class="line">That we the mercy of the waves should rue. </div>
            <div class="line">We readied the western world, a poor, devoted crew. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Oh! dreadful price of being to resign </div>
            <div class="line">All that is dear <em>in</em> being! better far </div>
            <div class="line">In Want’s most lonely cave till death to pine, </div>
            <div class="line">Unseen, unheard, unwatched by any star; </div>
            <div class="line">Or in the streets and walks where proud men are, </div>
            <div class="line">Better our dying bodies to obtrude, </div>
            <div class="line">Than dog-like, wading at the heels of war, </div>
            <div class="line">Protract a curst existence, with the brood </div>

         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">The pains and plagues that on our heads came down; </div>
            <div class="line">Disease and famine, agony and fear, </div>
            <div class="line">In wood or wilderness, in camp or town, </div>
            <div class="line">It would thy brain unsettle even to hear. </div>
            <div class="line">All perished—all, in one remorseless year, </div>
            <div class="line">Husband and children! one by one, by sword </div>
            <div class="line">And ravenous plague, all perished: every tear </div>
            <div class="line">Dried up, despairing, desolate, on board </div>
            <div class="line"> A British ship I waked, as from a trance restored. </div>

            <div class="line">In the calm sunshine slept the glittering main, </div>
            <div class="line">The very ocean has its hour of rest, </div>
            <div class="line">That comes not to the human mourner’s breast. </div>
            <div class="line">Remote from man, and storms of mortal care, </div>
            <div class="line"> A heavenly silence did the waves invest: </div>
            <div class="line"> I looked and looked along the silent air, </div>
            <div class="line">Until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair. </div>

            <div class="line">The breathing pestilence that rose like smoke! </div>
            <div class="line">The shriek that from the distant battle broke! </div>
            <div class="line">The mine’s dire earthquake, and the pallid host </div>

            <div class="line">To loathsome vaults, where heart-sick anguish toss’d, </div>

            <div class="line">And Murder, by the ghastly gleam, and Rape </div>
            <div class="line">Seized their joint prey, the mother and the child! </div>
            <div class="line">But from these crazing thoughts my brain, escape! </div>
            <div class="line">—For weeks the balmy air breathed soft and mild, </div>
            <div class="line">And on the gliding vessel Heaven and Ocean smiled. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Some mighty gulph of separation past, </div>
            <div class="line"> I seemed transported to another world:— </div>
            <div class="line"> A thought resigned with pain, when from the mast </div>
            <div class="line">The impatient mariner the sail unfurl’d, </div>
            <div class="line">And whistling, called the wind that hardly curled </div>
            <div class="line">The silent sea. From the sweet thoughts of home, </div>
            <div class="line">And from all hope I was forever hurled. </div>
            <div class="line">For me—farthest from earthly port to roam </div>
            <div class="line">Was best, could I but shun the spot where man might come. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And oft, robb’d of my perfect mind, I thought </div>
            <div class="line">At last my feet a resting-place had found: </div>
            <div class="line">Here will I weep in peace, (so fancy wrought,) </div>
            <div class="line">Roaming the illimitable waters round; </div>
            <div class="line">Here watch, of every human friend disowned, </div>
            <div class="line">All day, my ready tomb the ocean-flood— </div>
            <div class="line">To break my dream the vessel reached its bound: </div>
            <div class="line">And homeless near a thousand homes I stood, </div>
            <div class="line">And near a thousand tables pined, and wanted food. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">By grief enfeebled was I turned adrift, </div>
            <div class="line">Helpless as sailor cast on desert rock; </div>
            <div class="line">Nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift, </div>
            <div class="line">Nor dared my hand at any door to knock. </div>
            <div class="line"> I lay, where with his drowsy mates, the cock </div>
            <div class="line">From the cross timber of an out-house hung; </div>
            <div class="line">How dismal tolled, that night, the city clock! </div>
            <div class="line">At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung, </div>
            <div class="line">Nor to the beggar’s language could I frame my tongue. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">So passed another day, and so the third: </div>
            <div class="line">Then did I try, in vain, the crowd’s resort, </div>
            <div class="line">In deep despair by frightful wishes stirr’d, </div>
            <div class="line">Near the sea-side I reached a ruined fort: </div>
            <div class="line">There, pains which nature could no more support, </div>
            <div class="line">With blindness linked, did on my vitals fall; </div>
            <div class="line">Dizzy my brain, with interruption short </div>
            <div class="line">Of hideous sense; I sunk, nor step could crawl, </div>
            <div class="line">And thence was borne away to neighbouring hospital. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Recovery came with food: but still, my brain </div>
            <div class="line">Was weak, nor of the past had memory. </div>
            <div class="line"> I heard my neighbours, in their beds, complain </div>
            <div class="line">Of many things which never troubled me; </div>
            <div class="line">Of feet still bustling round with busy glee, </div>
            <div class="line">Of looks where common kindness had no part. </div>
            <div class="line">Of service done with careless cruelty, </div>
            <div class="line">Fretting the fever round the languid heart, </div>
            <div class="line">And groans, which, as they said, would make a dead man start. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">These things just served to stir the torpid sense, </div>
            <div class="line">Nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised. </div>
            <div class="line">Memory, though slow, returned with strength: and thence </div>
            <div class="line">Dismissed, again on open day I gazed, </div>
            <div class="line">At houses, men, and common light, amazed. </div>
            <div class="line">The lanes I sought, and as the sun retired, </div>
            <div class="line">Came, where beneath the trees a faggot blazed; </div>
            <div class="line">The wild brood saw me weep, my fate enquired, </div>
            <div class="line">And gave me food, and rest, more welcome, more desired. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">My heart is touched to think that men like these, </div>
            <div class="line">The rude earth’s tenants, were my first relief: </div>
            <div class="line">How kindly did they paint their vagrant ease! </div>
            <div class="line">And their long holiday that feared not grief, </div>
            <div class="line">For all belonged to all, and each was chief. </div>
            <div class="line">No plough their sinews strained; on grating road </div>
            <div class="line">No wain they drove, and yet, the yellow sheaf </div>
            <div class="line">In every vale for their delight was stowed: </div>
            <div class="line">For them, in nature’s meads, the milky udder flowed, </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Semblance, with straw and panniered ass, they made </div>
            <div class="line">Of potters wandering on from door to door: </div>
            <div class="line">But life of happier sort to me pourtrayed, </div>
            <div class="line">And other joys my fancy to allure; </div>
            <div class="line">The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor </div>
            <div class="line">In barn uplighted, and companions boon </div>
            <div class="line">Well met from far with revelry secure, </div>
            <div class="line">In depth of forest glade, when jocund June </div>
            <div class="line">Rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">But ill it suited me, in journey dark </div>
            <div class="line"> O’er moor and mountain, midnight theft to hatch; </div>
            <div class="line">To charm the surly house-dog’s faithful bark, </div>
            <div class="line">Or hang on tiptoe at the lifted latch; </div>
            <div class="line">The gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match, </div>
            <div class="line">The black disguise, the warning whistle shrill, </div>
            <div class="line">And ear still busy on its nightly watch, </div>
            <div class="line">Were not for me, brought up in nothing ill; </div>
            <div class="line">Besides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">What could I do, unaided and unblest? </div>
            <div class="line">Poor Father! gone was every friend of thine: </div>
            <div class="line">And kindred of dead husband are at best </div>
            <div class="line">Small help, and, after marriage such as mine, </div>
            <div class="line">With little kindness would to me incline. </div>
            <div class="line">Ill was I then for toil or service fit: </div>
            <div class="line">With tears whose course no effort could confine, </div>
            <div class="line">By high-way side forgetful would I sit </div>
            <div class="line">Whole hours, my idle arms in moping sorrow knit. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line"> I lived upon the mercy of the fields </div>
            <div class="line">And oft of cruelty the sky accused; </div>
            <div class="line">On hazard, or what general bounty yields. </div>
            <div class="line">Now coldly given, now utterly refused, </div>
            <div class="line">The fields I for my bed have often used: </div>
            <div class="line">But, what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth </div>
            <div class="line">Is, that I have my inner self abused, </div>
            <div class="line">Foregone the home delight of constant truth, </div>
            <div class="line">And clear and open soul, so prized in fearless youth. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Three years a wanderer, often have I view’d, </div>
            <div class="line">In tears, the sun towards that country tend </div>
            <div class="line">Where my poor heart lost all its fortitude: </div>
            <div class="line">And now across this moor my steps I bend— </div>
            <div class="line">Oh! tell me whither——for no earthly friend </div>
            <div class="line">Have I.——She ceased, and weeping turned away, </div>
            <div class="line">As if because her tale was at an end </div>
            <div class="line">She wept;—because she had no more to say </div>
            <div class="line">Of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay. </div>

         <h2>SIMON LEE,</h2>
         <h3>THE OLD HUNTSMAN,</h3>
         <h3>With an incident in which he was concerned.</h3>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">In the sweet shire of Cardigan, </div>
            <div class="line">Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall, </div>
            <div class="line">An old man dwells, a little man, </div>
            <div class="line"> I’ve heard he once was tall. </div>
            <div class="line">Of years he has upon his back, </div>
            <div class="line">No doubt, a burthen weighty; </div>
            <div class="line">He says he is three score and ten, </div>
            <div class="line">But others say he’s eighty. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line"> A long blue livery-coat has he, </div>
            <div class="line">That’s fair behind, and fair before; </div>
            <div class="line">Yet, meet him where you will, you see </div>
            <div class="line">At once that he is poor. </div>
            <div class="line">Full five and twenty years he lived </div>
            <div class="line"> A running huntsman merry; </div>
            <div class="line">And, though he has but one eye left, </div>
            <div class="line">His cheek is like a cherry. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">No man like him the horn could sound, </div>
            <div class="line">And no man was so full of glee; </div>
            <div class="line">To say the least, four counties round. </div>
            <div class="line">Had heard of Simon Lee; </div>
            <div class="line">His master’s dead, and no one now </div>
            <div class="line">Dwells in the hall of Ivor; </div>
            <div class="line">Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead; </div>
            <div class="line">He is the sole survivor. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">His hunting feats have him bereft </div>
            <div class="line">Of his right eye, as you may see: </div>
            <div class="line">And then, what limbs those feats have left </div>
            <div class="line">To poor old Simon Lee! </div>
            <div class="line">He has no son, he has no child, </div>
            <div class="line">His wife, an aged woman, </div>
            <div class="line">Lives with him, near the waterfall, </div>
            <div class="line">Upon the village common. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And he is lean and he is sick, </div>
            <div class="line">His dwindled body’s half awry, </div>
            <div class="line">His ancles they are swoln and thick; </div>
            <div class="line">His legs are thin and dry. </div>
            <div class="line">When he was young he little knew </div>
            <div class="line">’Of husbandry or tillage; </div>
            <div class="line">And now he’s forced to work, though weak, </div>
            <div class="line">—The weakest in the village. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">He all the country could outrun, </div>
            <div class="line">Could leave both man and horse behind; </div>
            <div class="line">And often, ere the race was done, </div>
            <div class="line">He reeled and was stone-blind. </div>
            <div class="line">And still there’s something in the world </div>
            <div class="line">At which his heart rejoices; </div>
            <div class="line">For when the chiming bounds are out, </div>
            <div class="line">He dearly loves their voices! </div>

            <div class="line">Old Ruth works out of doors with him. </div>

         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Beside their moss-grown hut of clay, </div>

            <div class="line"> A scrap of land they have, but they </div>

            <div class="line">Enclosed when he was stronger; </div>
            <div class="line">But what avails the land to them, </div>

            <div class="line">My gentle reader, I perceive </div>
            <div class="line">How patiently you’ve waited, </div>
            <div class="line">And I’m afraid that you expect </div>

         <h3>Written in April, 1798.</h3>

            <div class="line">No cloud, no relique of the sunken day </div>

            <div class="line">But hear no murmuring: it flows silently </div>
            <div class="line"> O’er its soft bed of verdure. All is still, </div>
            <div class="line"> A balmy night! and tho’ the stars be dim, </div>
            <div class="line">Yet let us think upon the vernal showers </div>
            <div class="line">That gladden the green earth, and we shall find </div>

            possesses an excellence far superior to that of mere description: it is spoken in the
            character of the melancholy Man, and has therefore a dramatic propriety. The Author
            makes this remark, to rescue himself from the charge of having alluded with levity to a
            line in Milton: a charge than which none could be more painful to him, except perhaps
            that of having ridiculed his Bible.] </div>

            <div class="line">Suspends his sobs, and laughs most silently, </div>
            <div class="line">While his fair eyes that swam with undropt tears </div>
            <div class="line">Did glitter in the yellow moon-beam! Well— </div>
            <div class="line">It is a father’s tale. But if that Heaven </div>
            <div class="line">Should give me life, his childhood shall grow up </div>
            <div class="line">Familiar with these songs, that with the night </div>
            <div class="line">He may associate Joy! Once more farewell, </div>
            <div class="line">Sweet Nightingale! once more, my friends! farewell. </div>

            <div class="line">Is sick, and makes a piteous moan, </div>
            <div class="line">As if her very life would fail. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">There’s not a house within a mile, </div>
            <div class="line">No hand to help them in distress; </div>
            <div class="line">Old Susan lies a bed in pain, </div>
            <div class="line">And sorely puzzled are the twain, </div>
            <div class="line">For what she ails they cannot guess. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Betty’s husband’s at the wood, </div>
            <div class="line">Where by the week he doth abide, </div>
            <div class="line"> A woodman in the distant vale; </div>
            <div class="line">There’s none to help poor Susan Gale, </div>
            <div class="line">What must be done? what will betide? </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Betty from the lane has fetched </div>
            <div class="line">Her pony, that is mild and good, </div>
            <div class="line">Whether he be in joy or pain, </div>
            <div class="line">Feeding at will along the lane, </div>
            <div class="line">Or bringing faggots from the wood. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And he is all in travelling trim, </div>
            <div class="line">And by the moonlight, Betty Foy </div>
            <div class="line">Has up upon the saddle set, </div>
            <div class="line">The like was never heard of yet, </div>
            <div class="line">Him whom she loves, her idiot boy. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And he must post without delay </div>
            <div class="line">Across the bridge that’s in the dale, </div>
            <div class="line">And by the church, and o’er the down, </div>
            <div class="line">To bring a doctor from the town, </div>
            <div class="line">Or she will die, old Susan Gale. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">There is no need of boot or spur, </div>
            <div class="line">There is no need of whip or wand, </div>
            <div class="line">For Johnny has his holly-bough, </div>
            <div class="line">And with a hurly-burly now </div>
            <div class="line">He shakes the green bough in his hand. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Betty o’er and o’er has told </div>
            <div class="line">The boy who is her best delight, </div>
            <div class="line">Both what to follow, what to shun, </div>
            <div class="line">What do, and what to leave undone, </div>
            <div class="line">How turn to left, and how to right. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Betty’s most especial charge, </div>
            <div class="line">Was, “Johnny! Johnny! mind that you </div>
            <div class="line">Come home again, nor stop at all, </div>
            <div class="line">Come home again, whate’er befal, </div>
            <div class="line">My Johnny do, I pray you do.” </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">To this did Johnny answer make, </div>
            <div class="line">Both with his head, and with his hand, </div>
            <div class="line">And proudly shook the bridle too, </div>
            <div class="line">And then! his words were not a few, </div>
            <div class="line">Which Betty well could understand. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And now that Johnny is just going, </div>
            <div class="line">Though Betty’s in a mighty flurry, </div>
            <div class="line">She gently pats the pony’s side, </div>
            <div class="line">On which her idiot boy must ride, </div>
            <div class="line">And seems no longer in a hurry. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">But when the pony moved his legs, </div>
            <div class="line">Oh! then for the poor idiot boy! </div>
            <div class="line">For joy he cannot hold the bridle, </div>
            <div class="line">For joy his head and heels are idle, </div>
            <div class="line">He’s idle all for very joy. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And while the pony moves his legs, </div>
            <div class="line">In Johnny’s left hand you may see, </div>
            <div class="line">The green bough’s motionless and dead: </div>
            <div class="line">The moon that shines above his head </div>
            <div class="line">Is not more still and mute than he. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">His heart it was so full of glee, </div>
            <div class="line">That till full fifty yards were gone, </div>
            <div class="line">He quite forgot his holly whip, </div>
            <div class="line">And all his skill in horsemanship, </div>
            <div class="line">Oh! happy, happy, happy John. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Betty’s standing at the door, </div>
            <div class="line">And Betty’s face with joy o’erflows, </div>
            <div class="line">Proud of herself, and proud of him, </div>
            <div class="line">She sees him in his travelling trim; </div>
            <div class="line">How quietly her Johnny goes. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">The silence of her idiot boy, </div>
            <div class="line">What hopes it sends to Betty’s heart! </div>
            <div class="line">He’s at the guide-post—he turns right, </div>
            <div class="line">She watches till he’s out of sight, </div>
            <div class="line">And Betty will not then depart. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Burr, burr—now Johnny’s lips they burr, </div>
            <div class="line">As loud as any mill, or near it, </div>
            <div class="line">Meek as a lamb the pony moves, </div>
            <div class="line">And Johnny makes the noise he loves, </div>
            <div class="line">And Betty listens, glad to hear it. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Away she hies to Susan Gale: </div>
            <div class="line">And Johnny’s in a merry tune, </div>
            <div class="line">The owlets hoot, the owlets purr, </div>
            <div class="line">And Johnny’s lips they burr, burr, burr, </div>
            <div class="line">And on he goes beneath the moon. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">His steed and he right well agree, </div>
            <div class="line">For of this pony there’s a rumour, </div>
            <div class="line">That should he lose his eyes and ears, </div>
            <div class="line">And should he live a thousand years, </div>
            <div class="line">He never will be out of humour. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">But then he is a horse that thinks! </div>
            <div class="line">And when he thinks his pace is slack; </div>
            <div class="line">Now, though he knows poor Johnny well, </div>
            <div class="line">Yet for his life he cannot tell </div>
            <div class="line">What he has got upon his back. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">So through the moonlight lanes they go, </div>
            <div class="line">And far into the moonlight dale, </div>
            <div class="line">And by the church, and o’er the down, </div>
            <div class="line">To bring a doctor from the town, </div>
            <div class="line">To comfort poor old Susan Gale. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Betty, now at Susan’s side, </div>
            <div class="line">Is in the middle of her story, </div>
            <div class="line">What comfort Johnny soon will bring, </div>
            <div class="line">With many a most diverting thing, </div>
            <div class="line">Of Johnny’s wit and Johnny’s glory. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Betty’s still at Susan’s side: </div>
            <div class="line">By this time she’s not quite so flurried; </div>
            <div class="line">Demure with porringer and plate </div>
            <div class="line">She sits, as if in Susan’s fate </div>
            <div class="line">Her life and soul were buried. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">But Betty, poor good woman! she, </div>
            <div class="line">You plainly in her face may read it, </div>
            <div class="line">Could lend out of that moment’s store </div>
            <div class="line">Five years of happiness or more, </div>
            <div class="line">To any that might need it. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">But yet I guess that now and then </div>
            <div class="line">With Betty all was not so well, </div>
            <div class="line">And to the road she turns her ears, </div>
            <div class="line">And thence full many a sound she hears, </div>
            <div class="line">Which she to Susan will not tell. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans, </div>
            <div class="line">“As sure as there’s a moon in heaven,” </div>
            <div class="line">Cries Betty, “he’ll be back again; </div>
            <div class="line">They’ll both be here, ’tis almost ten, </div>
            <div class="line">They’ll both be here before eleven.” </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans, </div>
            <div class="line">The clock gives warning for eleven; </div>
            <div class="line">’Tis on the stroke—“If Johnny’s near,” </div>
            <div class="line">Quoth Betty “he will soon be here, </div>
            <div class="line">As sure as there’s a moon in heaven.” </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">The clock is on the stroke of twelve, </div>
            <div class="line">And Johnny is not yet in sight, </div>
            <div class="line">The moon’s in heaven, as Betty sees, </div>
            <div class="line">But Betty is not quite at ease; </div>
            <div class="line">And Susan has a dreadful night. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Betty, half an hour ago, </div>
            <div class="line">On Johnny vile reflections cast: </div>
            <div class="line">“A little idle sauntering thing!” </div>
            <div class="line">With other names, an endless string. </div>
            <div class="line">But now that time is gone and past. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Betty’s drooping at the heart. </div>
            <div class="line">That happy time all past and gone, </div>
            <div class="line">“How can it be he is so late? </div>
            <div class="line">The Doctor he has made him wait, </div>
            <div class="line">Susan! they’ll both be here anon.” </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Susan’s growing worse and worse, </div>
            <div class="line">And Betty’s in a sad quandary; </div>
            <div class="line">And then there’s nobody to say </div>
            <div class="line">If she must go or she must stay: </div>
            <div class="line">—She’s in a sad quandary. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">The clock is on the stroke of one; </div>
            <div class="line">But neither Doctor nor his guide </div>
            <div class="line">Appear along the moonlight road, </div>
            <div class="line">There’s neither horse nor man abroad, </div>
            <div class="line">And Betty’s still at Susan’s side. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And Susan she begins to fear </div>
            <div class="line">Of sad mischances not a few, </div>
            <div class="line">That Johnny may perhaps be drown’d, </div>
            <div class="line">Or lost perhaps, and never found; </div>
            <div class="line">Which they must both for ever rue. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">She prefaced half a hint of this </div>
            <div class="line">With, “God forbid it should be true!” </div>
            <div class="line">At the first word that Susan said </div>
            <div class="line">Cried Betty, rising from the bed, </div>
            <div class="line">“Susan, I’d gladly stay with you.” </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">“I must be gone, I must away, </div>
            <div class="line">Consider, Johnny’s but half-wise; </div>
            <div class="line">Susan, we must take care of him, </div>
            <div class="line">If he is hurt in life or limb”— </div>
            <div class="line">“Oh God forbid!” poor Susan cries. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">“What can I do?” says Betty, going, </div>
            <div class="line">“What can I do to ease your pain? </div>
            <div class="line">Good Susan tell me, and I’ll stay; </div>
            <div class="line"> I fear you’re in a dreadful way, </div>
            <div class="line">But I shall soon be back again.” </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">“Nay, Betty, go! good Betty, go! </div>
            <div class="line">There’s nothing that can ease my pain.” </div>
            <div class="line">Then off she hies, but with a prayer </div>
            <div class="line">That God poor Susan’s life would spare, </div>
            <div class="line">Till she comes back again. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">So, through the moonlight lane she goes, </div>
            <div class="line">And far into the moonlight dale; </div>
            <div class="line">And how she ran, and how she walked, </div>
            <div class="line">And all that to herself she talked, </div>
            <div class="line">Would surely be a tedious tale. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">In high and low, above, below, </div>
            <div class="line">In great and small, in round and square, </div>
            <div class="line">In tree and tower was Johnny seen, </div>
            <div class="line">In bush and brake, in black and green, </div>
            <div class="line">’Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">She’s past the bridge that’s in the dale, </div>
            <div class="line">And now the thought torments her sore, </div>
            <div class="line">Johnny perhaps his horse forsook, </div>
            <div class="line">To hunt the moon that’s in the brook, </div>
            <div class="line">And never will be heard of more. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And now she’s high upon the down, </div>
            <div class="line">Alone amid a prospect wide; </div>
            <div class="line">There’s neither Johnny nor his horse, </div>
            <div class="line">Among the fern or in the gorse; </div>
            <div class="line">There’s neither doctor nor his guide. </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">“Oh saints! what is become of him? </div>
            <div class="line">Perhaps he’s climbed into an oak, </div>
            <div class="line">Where he will stay till he is dead; </div>
            <div class="line">Or sadly he has been misled, </div>
            <div class="line">And joined the wandering gypsey-folk.” </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">“Or him that wicked pony’s carried </div>

            <div class="line">Or in the castle he’s pursuing, </div>
            <div class="line">Among the ghosts, his own undoing; </div>
            <div class="line">Or playing with the waterfall,” </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">At poor old Susan then she railed, </div>

         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">Poor Betty! in this sad distemper, </div>
            <div class="line">The doctor’s self would hardly spare, </div>
            <div class="line">Unworthy things she talked and wild, </div>

            <div class="line">And thus to Betty’s question, he, </div>

         <div class="footNote">NOTE to the ANCIENT MARINER.—I cannot refuse myself the gratification
            of informing such Readers as may have been pleased with this Poem, or with any part of
            it, that they owe their pleasure in some sort to me; as the Author was himself very
            desirous that it should be suppressed. This wish had arisen from a consciousness of the
            defects of the Poem, and from a knowledge that many persons had been much displeased
            with it. The Poem of my Friend has indeed great defects; first, that the principal
            person has no distinct character, either in his profession of Mariner, or as a human
            being who having been long under the controul of supernatural impressions might be
            supposed himself to partake of something supernatural: secondly, that he does not act,
            but is continually acted upon: thirdly, that the events having no necessary connection
            do not produce each other; and lastly, that the imagery is somewhat too laboriously
            accumulated. Yet the Poem contains many delicate touches of passion, and indeed the
            passion is every where true to nature; a great number of the stanzas present beautiful
            images, and are expressed with unusual felicity of language; and the versification,
            though the metre is itself unfit for long poems, is harmonious and artfully varied,
            exhibiting the utmost powers of that metre, and every variety of which it is capable. It
            therefore appeared to me that these several merits (the first of which, namely that of
            the passion, is of the highest kind,) gave to the Poem a value which is not often
            possessed by better Poems. On this account I requested of my Friend to permit me to
            republish it. </div>

            <div class="line">Of sportive wood run wild; these pastoral farms </div>
            <div class="line">Green to the very door; and wreathes of smoke </div>
            <div class="line">Sent up, in silence, from among the trees, </div>
            <div class="line">With some uncertain notice, as might seem, </div>
            <div class="line">Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods, </div>
            <div class="line">Or of some hermit’s cave, where by his fire </div>
            <div class="line">The hermit sits alone. </div>

            <div class="line">As is a landscape to a blind man’s eye: </div>
            <div class="line">But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the din </div>
            <div class="line">Of towns and cities, I have owed to them, </div>
            <div class="line">In hours of wariness, sensations sweet, </div>
            <div class="line">Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart, </div>

            <div class="line">Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps, </div>
            <div class="line">As may have had no trivial influence </div>
            <div class="line">On that best portion of a good man’s life; </div>
            <div class="line">His little, nameless, unremembered acts </div>
            <div class="line">Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust, </div>
            <div class="line">To them I may have owed another gift, </div>
            <div class="line">Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood, </div>
            <div class="line">In which the burthen of the mystery, </div>
            <div class="line">In which the heavy and the weary weight </div>
            <div class="line">Of all this unintelligible world </div>
            <div class="line">Is lighten’d:—that serene and blessed mood; </div>
            <div class="line">In which the affections gently lead us on, </div>
            <div class="line">Until, the breath of this corporeal frame, </div>
            <div class="line">And even the motion of our human blood </div>
            <div class="line">Almost suspended, we are laid asleep </div>
            <div class="line">In body, and become a living soul: </div>
            <div class="line">While with an eye made quiet by the power </div>
            <div class="line">Of harmony, and the deep power of joy, </div>
            <div class="line">We see into the life of things. </div>

            <div class="line">In darkness, and amid the many shapes </div>
            <div class="line">Of joyless day-light; when the fretful stir </div>
            <div class="line">Unprofitable, and the fever of the world, </div>
            <div class="line">Have hung upon the beatings of my heart, </div>

            <div class="line"> O sylvan Wye! Thou wanderer through the woods, </div>
            <div class="line">How often has my spirit turned to thee! </div>
         </div>
         <div class="lg">
            <div class="line">And now, with gleams, of half-extinguish’d thought, </div>
            <div class="line">With many recognitions dim and faint, </div>
            <div class="line">And somewhat of a sad perplexity, </div>
            <div class="line">The picture of the mind revives again: </div>
            <div class="line">While here I stand, not only with the sense </div>
            <div class="line">Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts </div>
            <div class="line">That in this moment there is life and food </div>
            <div class="line">For future years. And so I dare to hope </div>
            <div class="line">Though changed, no doubt, from what I was, when first </div>
            <div class="line"> I came among these hills; when like a roe </div>
            <div class="line"> I bounded o’er the mountains, by the sides </div>
            <div class="line">Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams, </div>
            <div class="line">Wherever nature led: more like a man </div>
            <div class="line">Flying from something that he dreads, than one </div>
            <div class="line">Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then </div>
            <div class="line">(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days, </div>
            <div class="line">And their glad animal movements all gone by,) </div>
            <div class="line">To me was all in all.—I cannot paint </div>
            <div class="line">What then I was. The sounding cataract </div>
            <div class="line">Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock, </div>
            <div class="line">The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, </div>
            <div class="line">Their colours and their forms, were then to me </div>
            <div class="line">An appetite: a feeling and a love, </div>
            <div class="line">That had no need of a remoter charm, </div>
            <div class="line">By thought supplied, or any interest </div>
            <div class="line">Unborrowed from the eye.—That time is past, </div>
            <div class="line">And all its aching joys are now no more, </div>
            <div class="line">And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this </div>
            <div class="line">Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur: other gifts </div>
            <div class="line">Have followed, for such loss, I would believe </div>
            <div class="line">Abundant recompence. For I have learned </div>
            <div class="line">To look on nature, not as in the hour </div>
            <div class="line">Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes </div>
            <div class="line">The still, sad music of humanity, </div>
            <div class="line">Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power </div>
            <div class="line">To chasten and subdue. And I have felt </div>
            <div class="line"> A presence that disturbs me with the joy </div>
            <div class="line">Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime </div>
            <div class="line">Of something far more deeply interfused, </div>
            <div class="line">Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, </div>
            <div class="line">And the round ocean, and the living air, </div>
            <div class="line">And the blue sky, and in the mind of man, </div>
            <div class="line"> A motion and a spirit, that impels </div>
            <div class="line">All thinking things, all objects of all thought, </div>
            <div class="line">And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still </div>
            <div class="line"> A lover of the meadows and the woods, </div>
            <div class="line">And mountains; and of all that we behold </div>
