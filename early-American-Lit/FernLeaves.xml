            <p>Well baptized: fresh, hardy, and grown for the masses. Not more welcome is their
               natural type to the winter-bound, bed-ridden, and spring-emancipated invalid. <title
                  level="m">Leaves of Grass</title> thou art unspeakably delicious, after the
               forced, stiff, Parnassian exotics for which our admiration has been vainly
               challenged.</p>
            <p>Walt Whitman, the effeminate world needed thee. The timidest soul whose wings ever
               drooped with discouragement, could not choose but rise on thy strong pinions.</p>
            <q><lg>
                  <l>Undrape—you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded;</l>
                  <l>I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no. . . .</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>O despairer, here is my neck,</l>
                  <l>You shall <emph>not</emph> go down! Hang your whole weight upon me.</l>
               </lg></q>
            <p>Walt Whitman, the world needed a <soCalled>Native American</soCalled> of thorough,
               out-and-out breed—enamored of <emph>women</emph> not <emph>ladies</emph>,
                  <emph>men</emph> not <emph>gentlemen</emph>; something beside a mere
               Catholic-hating Know-Nothing; it needed a man who dared speak out his strong, honest
               thoughts, in the face of pusillanimous, todeying, republican aristocracy;
               dictionary-men, hypocrites, cliques, and creeds; it needed a large-hearted,
               untainted, self-reliant, fearless son of the Stars and Stripes, who disdains to sell
               his birthright for a mess of pottage; who does <q><l>Not call one greater or one
                     smaller,</l>
                  <l>That which fills its period and place being equal to any;</l></q> who will
                     <q><l>Accept nothing which all cannot have on their counterpart of on the same
                     terms.</l></q>
            </p>
            <p>Fresh <title level="m">Leaves of Grass</title>! not submitted by the self-reliant
               author to the fingering of any publisher’s critic, to be arranged, re-arranged and
               disarranged to his circumscribed liking, till they hung limp, tame, spiritless, and
               scentless. No. It were a spectacle worth seeing, this glorious Native American, who,
               when the daily labor of chisel and plane was over, himself, with toil-hardened
               fingers, handled the types to print the pages which wise and good men have since
               delighted to endorse and to honor. Small critics, whose contracted vision could see
               no beauty, strength, or grace, in these <title level="m">Leaves</title>, have long
               ago repented that they so hastily wrote themselves down shallow by such a premature
               confession. Where an Emerson, and a Howitt have commended, my woman’s voice of praise
               may not avail; but happiness was born a twin, and so I would fain share with others
               the unmingled delight which these <title level="m">Leaves</title> have given me.</p>
            <p>I say unmingled; I am not unaware that the charge of coarseness and sensuality has
               been affixed to them. My moral constitution may be hopelessly tainted—or too sound to
               be tainted, as the critic wills—but I confess that I extract no poison from these
                  <title level="m">Leaves</title>—to methey have brought only healing. Let him who
               can do so, shroud the eyes of the nursing babe lest it should see its mother’s
               breast. Let him look carefully between the gilded covers of books, backed by
               high-sounding names, and endorsed by parson and priest, lying unrebuked upon his own
               family table; where the asp of sensuality likes coiled amid rhetorical flowers. Let
               him examine well the paper dropped weekly at his door, in which virtue and religion
               are rendered disgusting, save when they walk in satin slippers, or, clothed in purple
               and fine linen, kneel on a damask <soCalled><foreign xml:lang="fr"
                     >prie-dieu</foreign></soCalled>.</p>
            <p>Sensual! No—the moral assassin looks you not so boldly in the eye by broad daylight;
               but Borgia-like takes you treacherously by the hand, while from the glittering ring
               on his finger he distils through your veins the subtle and deadly poison.</p>
            <p>Sensual? The artist who would inflame, paints you not nude Nature, but stealing
               Virtue’s veil, with artful artlessness now conceals, now exposes, the ripe and
               swelling proportions.</p>
            <p>Sensual? Let him who would affix this stigma upon <title level="m">Leaves of
                  Grass</title>, write upon his heart, in letters of fire, these noble words of its
               author:</p>
            <q><lg>
                  <l>In woman I see the bearer of the great fruit, which is immortality</l>
                  <l>. . . the good thereof is not tasted by <foreign xml:lang="fr">roues</foreign>,
                     and never can be. . . .</l>
                  <l>Who degraded or defiles the living human body is cursed,</l>
                  <l>Who degrades or defiles the body of the dead is not more cursed.</l>
               </lg></q>
            <p>Were I an artist I would like no more suggestive subjects for my easel than Walt
               Whitman’s pen has furnished.</p>
            <q><lg>
                  <l>The little one sleeps in its cradle,</l>
                  <l>I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my
                     hand.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>The farmer stops by the bars of a Sunday and looks at the oats and rye. . .</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!</l>
                  <l>Earth of departed Sunset!</l>
                  <l>Earth of the mountain’s misty topt</l>
                  <l>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!</l>
                  <l>Earth of the shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!</l>
                  <l>Earth of the limpid grey of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!</l>
                  <l>Far swooping elbowed earth! Rich apple-blossomed earth!</l>
                  <l>Smile, for your lover comes!</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>I quote at random, the following passages which appeal to me:</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>A morning glory at my window, satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.
                     . . .</l>
                  <l>Logic and sermons never convince.</l>
                  <l>The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Speaking of animals, he says:</p>
            <q><lg>
                  <l>I stand and look at them sometimes half the day long.</l>
                  <l><emph>They</emph> do not make me sick, discussing their duty to God. . . .</l>
                  <l>Whoever walks a furlong without sympathy, walks to his funeral dressed in his
                     shroud. . . .</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I hate him that oppresses me,</l>
                  <l>I will either destroy him, or he shall release me. . . .</l>
                  <l>I find letters from God dropped in teh street, and every one is signed by God’s
                     name,</l>
                  <l>And I leave them where they are, for I know that others will punctually come

            <p>I close the extracts from these <title level="m">Leaves</title>, which it were easy
               to multiply , for one is more puzled what to leave unculled, than what to gather,
               with the following sentiments; for which, and for allt he good things included
               between the covers of his book, Mr. Whitman will please accept the cordial grasp of a

            <q><lg>
                  <l>The wife—and she is not one jot less than the husband,</l>
                  <l>The daughter—and she is just as good as the son,</l>

            <head type="title">Fresh Leaves</head>
            <p>This little volume has just been laid upon our table. The publishers have done all
               they could for it, with regard to outward adorning. No doubt it will be welcomed by
               those who admire this lady’s style of writing: we confess ourselves not to be of that
               number. We have never seen Fanny Fern, nor do we desire to do so. We imagine her,
               from her writings, to be a muscular, black-browed, grenadier-looking female, who
               would be more at home in a boxing gallery than in a parlor,—a vociferous,
               demonstrative, strong-minded horror,—a woman only by virtue of her dress. Bah! the
               very thought sickens us. We have read, or, rather, tried to read, her halloo-there
               effusions. When we take up a woman’s book we expect to find gentleness, timidity,
               that lovely reliance on the patronage of our sex which constitutes a woman’s greatest
               charm. We do not wish to be startled by bold expressions, or disgusted with
               exhibitions of masculine weaknesses. We do not desire to see a woman wielding the
               scimitar blade of sarcasm. If she be, unfortunately, endowed with a gift so
               dangerous, let her—as she values the approbation of our sex—fold it in a napkin.
               Fanny’s strong-minded nose would probably turn up at this inducement. Thank heaven!
               there are still women who <emph>are</emph> women—who know the proper place Heaven
               assigned them, and keep it—who do not waste floods of ink and paper, brow-beating men
               and stirring up silly women;—who do not teach children that a game of romps is of as
               much importance as Blairs Philosophy;—who have not the presumption to advise
               clergymen as to their duties, or lecture doctors, and savans;—who live for something
               else than to astonish a gaping, idiotic crowd. Thank heaven! there are women writers
               who do not disturb our complacence or serenity; whose books lull one to sleep like a
               strain of gentle music; who excite no antagonism, or angry feeling. Woman never was
               intended for an irritant: she should be oil upon the troubled waters of manhood—soft
               and amalgamating, a necessary but unobtrusive ingredient;—never challenging
               attention—never throwing the gauntlet of defiance to a beard, but softly purring
               beside it lest it bristle and scratch.</p>
            <p>The very fact that Fanny Fern has, in the language of her admirers, <q>elbowed her
                  way through unheard of difficulties,</q> shows that she is an antagonistic,
               pugilistic female. One must needs, forsooth, get out of her way, or be pushed one
               side, or trampled down. How much more womanly to have allowed herself to be doubled
               up by adversity, and quietly laid away on the shelf of fate, than to have rolled up
               her sleeves, and gone to fisticuffs with it. Such a woman may conquer, it is true,
               but her victory will cost her dear; it will neither be forgotten nor forgiven—let her
               put that in her apron pocket.</p>
            <p>As to Fanny Fern’s grammar, rhetoric, and punctuation, they are beneath criticism. It
               is all very well for her to say, those who wish commas, semi-colons and periods, must
               look for them in the printer’s case, or that she who finds ideas must not be expected
               to find rhetoric or grammar; for our part, we should be gratified if we had even
               found any ideas!</p>
            <p>We regret to be obliged to speak thus of a lady’s book: it gives us great pleasure,
               when we can do so conscientiously, to pat lady writers on the head; but we owe a duty
               to the public which will not permit us to recommend to their favorable notice an
               aspirant who has been unwomanly enough so boldly to contest every inch of ground in
               order to reach them—an aspirant at once so high-stepping and so ignorant, so
               plausible, yet so pernicious. We have a conservative horror of this pop-gun, torpedo
               female; we predict for Fanny Fern’s <title level="m">Leaves</title> only a fleeting
               autumnal flutter.</p>

            <head>A Law More Nice Than Just</head>
            <p>Here I have been sitting twiddling the morning paper between my fingers this half hour, reflecting upon the following paragraph in it: <q>Emma Wilson was arrested yesterday for wearing man’s apparel.</q> Now, why this should be an actionable offense is past my finding out, or where’s the harm in it, I am as much at a loss to see. Think of the old maids (and weep) who have to stay at home evening after evening, when, if they provided themselves with a coat, pants, and hat, they might go abroad, instead of sitting there with their noses flattened against the window-pane, looking vainly for <soCalled>the Coming Man</soCalled>. Think of the married women who stay at home after their day’s toil is done, waiting wearily for their thoughtless, truant husbands, when they might be taking the much needed independent walk in trousers, which forbids to petticoats. And this, I fancy, may be the secret of this famous law—who knows? It <emph>wouldn’t</emph> be pleasant for some of them to be surprised by a touch on the shoulder from some dapper young fellow, whose familiar treble voice belied his corduroys. That’s it, now. What a fool I was not to think of it—not to remember that men who make the laws, make them to meet all these little emergencies.</p>
            <p>Everybody knows what an everlasting drizzle of rain we have had lately, but nobody but a woman, and a woman who lives on fresh air and out-door exercise, knows the thraldom of taking her daily walk through a three weeks’ rain, with skirts to hold up, and umbrella to hold down, and puddles to skip over, and gutters to walk round, and all the time in a fright lest, in an unguarded moment, her calves should become visible to some one of those rainy-day philanthropists who are interested in the public study of female anatomy.</p>
            <p>One evening, after a long rainy day of scribbling, when my nerves were in double-twisted knots, and I felt as if myriads of little ants were leisurely traveling over me, and all for want of the walk, which is my daily salvation, I stood at the window, looking at the slanting, persistent rain, and took my resolve: <q><emph>I’ll do it</emph></q>, said I, audibly, planting my slipper upon the carpet. <q>Do what?</q> asked Mr. Fern, looking up from a big book. <q>Put on a suit of your clothes and take a tramp with your</q>, was the answer. <q>You dare not</q>, was the rejoinder; <q>you are a little coward, only saucy on paper</q>. It was the work of a moment, with such a challenge, to fly up stairs and overhaul my philosopher’s wardrobe. Of course we had fun. Tailors must be a stingy set, I remarked, to be so sparing of their cloth, as I struggled into a pair of their handiwork, undeterred by the vociferous laughter of the wretch who had solmenly vowed to <q>cherish me</q> through all my tribulations. <q>Upon my word, everything seems to be narrow where it ought to be broad, and the waist of this coat might be made for a hogshead; and ugh! this shirt collar is cutting my ears off, and you ahve not a decent cravat in the whole lot, and your vests are frights, and what am I to do with my hair?</q> Still no reply from Mr. Fern, who lay on th efloor, faintly ejaculating, between his fits of laughter, <q>Oh, my! by Jove!—oh! by Jupiter!</q></p>
            <p>Was that to hinder me? Of course not. Strings and pins, women’s never-failing resort, soon brought broadcloth and kerseymere to terms. I parted my hair on one side, rolled i under, and then secured it with hairpins; chose the best fitting coat, and cap-ping the climax with one of those soft, cosy hats, looked in the glass, where I beheld the very fac-simile of a certain musical gentleman, whose photograph hangs this minute in Brady’s entry.<note resp="#ebb">Fern is referring to her brother, Richard Storrs Willis.</note></p>
            <p>Well, Mr. Fern seized his hat, and out we went together. <q>Fanny</q>, said he, <q>you must not take my arm; you are a fellow.</q> <q>True</q>, said I. <q>I forgot; and you must not help me over puddless, as you did just now, and do, for mercy’s sake, stop laughing. There, there goes your hat—I mean <emph>my</emph> hat; confound the wind! and down comes my hair; lucky ’tis dark, isn’t it?</q> But oh, the delicious freedom of that walk; after we were well started! No skirts to hold up, or to draggle their wet folds against my ankles; no stifling vail flapping in my face, and blinding my eyes; no umbrella to turn inside out, but instead, the cool rain driving slap into my face, and the resurrectionized blood coursing through my veins, and tingling in my cheeks. To be sure, Mr. Fern occasionally loitered behind, and leaned up against the side of a house to enjoy a little private <soCalled>guffaw</soCalled>, adn I could now and then hear a gasping <q>Oh, Fanny! Oh my!</q> but none of these things moved me, and if I don’t have a nicely-fitting suit of my own to wear rainy evenings, it is because—well, there <emph>are</emph> difficulties in the way. Who’s the best tailor?</p>
            <p>Now, if any male or female Miss Nancy who reads this feels shocked, let ’em! Any woman who likes, may stay at home during a three weeks’ rain, till her skin looks like parchment, and her eyes like those of a dead fish, or she may go out and get a consumption dragging round wet petticoats; I won’t—I positively declare I won’t. I shall begin <emph>evenings</emph> when <emph>that</emph> suit is made, and take private walking lessons with Mr. Fern, and they who choose may crook their backs at home for fashion, and then send for the doctor to straighten them; I prefer to patronize my shoe-maker and tailor. I’ve as good a right to preserve the healthy body God gave me, as if I were not a woman.</p>

   <head>A Law More Nice Than Just</head>
   <head type="sub">Number II</head>
   <p>After all, having tried it I affirm, that nothing reconciles a woman quicker to her feminity, than an experiment in male apparel, although I still maintain that she should not be forbidden by law to adopt it when necessity requires; at least, not till the practice is amended by which a female clerk, who performs her duty equally well with a male clerk, receives less salary, simply because she is a woman.</p>
   <p>To have to jump on to the cars when in motion, and scramble yourself on to the platform as best you may without a helping hand; to be nudged roughly in the ribs by the conductor with, <q>your fare, sir?</q> to have your pretty little toes trod on, and no healing <q>beg your pardon</q>, applied to the smart; to have all those nice-looking men who used to make you such crushing bows, and give you such insinuating smiles, pass you without the slightest interest in your coat tails, and perhaps push you against the wall or into the gutter, with a word tabooed by the clergy. In fine, to dispense with all those delicious little politenesses, (for men are great bears to each other,) to which one has been accustomed, and yet feel no inclination to take advantage of one’s corduroys and secure an equivalent by making interest with the <soCalled>fair sex</soCalled>, stale to you as a thrice-told tale. Isn’t <emph>that</emph> a situation?</p>
   <p>To be subject to the promptings of that unstifleable feminine desire for adornment, which is right and lovely within proper limits, and yet have no field for your operations. To have to conceal your silken hair, and yet be forbidden a becoming moustache, or whiskers, or beard—(all hail beards, I say!). To choke up your nice throat with a disguising cravat; to hide your bust (I trust no Miss Nancy is blushing) under a baggy vest. To have nobody ask you to ice cream, and yet be forbidden, by your horrible disgust of tobacco, to smoke. To have a gentleman ask you <q>the time sir?</q> when you are new to the geography of your watch-pocket. To accede to an invitation to test your <soCalled>heft</soCalled>, by sitting down in one of those street-weighing chairs, and have one of the male bystanders, taking hold of your foot, remark, <q>Halloo, sir, you must not rest these upon the ground while you are being weighed</q>; and go grinning away in your coat-sleeve at your truly feminine faux pas.</p>
   <p>And yet—and yet—to be able to step over the ferry-boat chain when you are in a distracted hurry, like any other fellow, without waiting for that tedious unhooking process, and quietly to enjoy your triumph over scores of impatient-waiting crushed petticoats behind you; to taste that nice lager beer <soCalled>on draught</soCalled>; to pick up contraband bits of science in a Medical Museum, forbidden to crinoline, and hold conversations with intelligent men, who supposing you to be a man, consequently talk sense to you. That is worth while.</p>
   <p>Take it all and all, though, I thank the gods I am a woman. I had rather be loved than make love; though I could beat the makers of it, out and out, if I did not think it my duty to refrain out of regard to their feelings, and the final disappointment of the deluded women! But—oh, dear, I want to do such a quantity of <soCalled>improper</soCalled> things, that there is not the slightest real harm in doing. I want to see and know a thousand things which are forbidden to flounces—custom only can tell why—I can’t. I want the free use of my ankles, for this summer at least, to take a journey; I want to climb and wade, and tramp about, without giving a thought to my clothes; without carrying about with me a long procession of trunks and boxes, which are the inevitable penalty of feminity as at present appareled. I hate a Bloomer, such as we have seen—words are weak to say how much; I hate myself as much in a man’s dress; and yet I want to run my fingers through my cropped hair some fine morning without the bore of dressing it; put on some sort of loose blouse affair—it must be pretty, though—and a pair of Turkish trousers—<emph>not</emph> Bloomers—and a cap, or hat—and start; nary a trunk—<q>nary</q> a bandbox. Wouldn’t that be fine? But propriety scowls and says, <q>ain’t you ashamed of yourself, Fanny Fern?</q> <emph>Yes, I am.</emph> Miss Nancy. I <emph>am</emph> ashamed of myself, that I haven’t the courage to carry out what would be so eminently convenient, and right, and proper under the circumstances. I am ashamed of myself that I sit like a fool on the piazza of some hotel every season, gazing at some distant mountain, which every pulse and muscle of my body, and every faculty of my soul, are urging me to climb, that I may <q>see the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them.</q> I <emph>am</emph> ashamed of myself that you, Miss Nancy, with your uplifted forefinger and your pursed-up mouth, should keep me out of a dress in which I can only hope to do such things. Can’t I make a compromise with you, Miss Nancy? for I’m getting restless, as these lovely summer days pass on. I’d write you such long accounts of beautiful things, Miss Nancy—things which God made for female as well as male eyes to see; and I should come home so strong and healthy, Miss Nancy—a freckle or two, perhaps—but who cares? O-h-n-o-w, Miss Nancy, d-o—Pshaw! you cross old termagant! May Lucifer fly away wid ye.</p>
